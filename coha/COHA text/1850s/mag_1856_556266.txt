ART . XII . - Life of William Plumer Governor of New Hampshire . By his Son , WILLIAM PLUMER , Junior . Edited , with a Sketch of the Author 's Life , by A. P. PEABODY . Boston : Phillips , Sampson , &amp; Co. 1856 . Svo. pp. 543 . IN these days , many students of the history of Presidential Elections will remember , that on the tabular record of the votes of old times there is the notice of an election , in which one elector threw his single vote against two hundred and thirty-one others . It was on the occasion of Mr. Monroe 's second election , and this single vote robbed him of the honor which , thus far , no one has shared with Washington , of receiving the unanimous choice of the Electoral Colleges . This solitary vote was thrown by Governor William Plumer of New Hampshire , the subject of the biography before us . It deserves special notice , as the only instance in which an elector , chosen by the people , has voted without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supposed theory of the Federal Constitution . That instrument confides the choice of President , not to the people , but to the electors . It seems to have been supposed that they , rather than any earlier caucus or convention , would weigh candidates , and decide who best would answer the necessities of the time and position . In reality , however , - as at this moment we know , - no discretion is now left in the electors ' hands . The people vote for them , with the distinct understanding , amounting to a pledge , in our present practice , that they will vote for a candidate already fixed upon . In the single exception which we have named to this general practice , * in the ninth election for President , at that period of political calm , just before the storm of the great Missouri debate , which was called the " era of good feeling , " Governor PRimer had been chosen , as a " Republican , " at the * In the election of 1824 , some votes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no electors were chosen whose vote was not pledged or known he . forehnnd .

But Mr. Monroe was supported , throughout the country , with what Mr. Randolph called the " unanimity of indifference . " In Richmond , the capital of his own State , he received seventeen votes only , no one voting against him . Indeed , there is said to have been no ticket run in opposition to him , except in Pennsylvania , where an " Antislavery ticket " received some votes , mostly in Philadelphia . In this " unanimity of indifference " the Electoral Colleges met . All the electors in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single exception that Governor William Plumer of New Hampshire , in opposition to the expectations of those who chose him , to the seven other electors of that State , and two hundred and twenty-four electors in other States , gave his vote for John Quincy Adams . History will be apt to say , that this simple protest was well and wisely made , - if , indeed , History ever has the leisure to go back and look up James Monroe in his oblivion . It is really matter of satisfaction that the splendid tribute of unanimous approbation given to Washington should not have been repeated , even through indifference , in the election to the Presidency of a man who left the army in the midst of the Revolution , " when superseded of his lineal rank " ; who used all his influence in Virginia to prevent the adoption of the Federal Constitution ; * who compelled Washington to recall him from the foreign mission which had been intrusted to him only in a spirit of conciliation ; j whose energy displayed itself most eminently when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Britain , for which they knew they were not prepared ; whose own administration is chiefly distinguished by the success with which it abetted the efforts to maintain slavery west of the Mississippi ; and whose name is now repeated only in connection with that remarkable " Monroe doctrine , " which , misunderstood and * See J. Q. Adams 's Eulogy on President Monroe . t Ibid. t Ibid . See T. II . Benton 's Thirty Years ' View , p. 6 . II Ibid , p. 8. // abused by politicians of the present day , yet in its first intent and true meaning both wise and timely , was originated not by him whose name it bears , but by another. * This solitary vote of Governor Plumer was justified by him because " He thought Mr. Monroe 's capacity by no means equal to the place . We mistake , ' he said , if we suppose that any but the ablest men are fit for the highest place . The government of weak men must always be disastrous . " Woe to thee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' He was influenced in part , perhaps , by a desire to draw attention to his friend Adams , whom he thus first nominated for the Presidency ; but more by his disapprobation of what he regarded as the wasteful extravagance of the public expenditure , during Monroe 's first term of service , which , instead of paying the public debt , had compelled a resort to loans in a time of peace . " This dissatisfaction with the course of public events was by no means confined to Governor Plumer . I was in Congress at the time , and saw much of it in that body . I received many congratulations on this vote of my father , from such men as Randolph , Macon , and other Republicans of the old school . Not that they liked Adams ( Randolph assailed him with the fury of hereditary hate ) ; but they disliked Monroe , whom they regarded as having adopted , chiefly under the influence of Calhoun , some of the worst heresies of the old Federal party . Randolph said in the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk of the unanimity of his re-election . Yes , sir ; but it is the unanimity of indifference , and not of approbation . Four years hence , he will go out , with equal unanimity ; and the feeling will then be , not indifference , but contempt . ' This bitter prophecy was , in some measure , verified , by the almost total oblivion into which Mr. Monroe fell , amidst the din of the contest which preceded and followed the election of his successor . Forgotten even before he left the White House , he was remembered afterwards , for a moment only , as an humble suppliant for the bounty of Congress , on one of whose most important acts he had , just before , put his veto .

" // 525 not wholly unimportant in itself , as an illustration of a sturdy , sometimes almost surly independence of character , which gives great freshness to his biography . The briefest sketch of hIs life will show that this independence of the views of his associates distinguished him from beginning to end . He was born in 1759 , in Newbury , Massachusetts , and renioved , when a boy , with his father , to Epping , New Hampshire , which was his home till he died in 1850 . Armed simply with the resources of such training as came from the diligent study of every book he could get at in this little town , he started upon life , under intense religious impulse , as a Baptist revival preacher . But he soon found himself overwhelmed by sceptical doubts , originating in the peculiar theology of his teachers , - and in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he relinquished the pulpit , and returned from his itinerancy to his home . Resorting to the study of the law , he prosecuted this , in the face of all advice to the contrary ; at last overcoming the scruples against it of his father and mother . He became a leading member of the New Hampshire bar , through a period when he measured strength with the Sullivans , Jeremiah Smith , Jeremiah Mason , Daniel Webster , and their associates . He was an active laborer in the formation of the Constitution of New Hampshire . He used all his efforts to secure the adoption of the Federal Constitution by that State , and afterwards in completing the organization of the Federalist party there . By that party he was sent to the United States Senate for the term which began at the same time with Mr. Jefferson 's administration . He opposed the measures of Mr. Jefferson 's first term with ardor , and acknowledges that he was at that time a " Disunionist " ; but the triumphant re-election of the President produced a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but as to the policy of further combined opposition to them . He attempted to break down party distinctions , and gradually drew nearer to the Democratic party . At the end of his term of office he was not re-elected , being " too much of a Federalist to have Republican votes , and too much of a Republican deeply to interest Federalists . " He voted for Madison as Jefferson 's successor , as the best man that could // LIFE OF WILLIAM PLTJMER. be chosen ; and , in 1812 , he was himself elected Governor of New Hampshire , by the Democratic or Republican party . He had not been Governor three weeks , when he received a requisition to detach militia troops for the defence of the State , which requisition he obeyed , " not taking counsel of flesh and blood , " as the political gossip of the times said that he declared . Whether he said so or not , it is certain that one of his customs was to take counsel of himself alone . He voted again for Madison in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pennsylvania , opposed him. * He sustained and signed the " Dartmouth University " act , which was afterwards set aside by the Supreme Court of the United States . In 1818 he left office , retired to private life , and never entered the public service again , except on the occasion of voting against Mr. Monroe , to which we have alluded . When the old Democratic party broke up , he voted for Mr. Adams for President , and looked with distress on General Jackson 's election . He occupied the leisure which remained to him , after leaving public life , in historical studies , and has left some valuable manuscripts unpublished . Through his life he maintained a close friendship , and in some instances an active correspondence , with prominent men in different parts of the country . And he was a keen observer . John Quincy Adams thought he saw more clearly and judged more coolly of men and things relating to the political world , than almost any man with whom he had acted in political life . It will readily be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose public life was mixed in , all through , with the history of the nation , from its very birth to the present time , presents constant points of interest . The author , Mr. William Plumer , Jr. , the son of Governor Plumer , executed his work with great care and skill . The narrative is classical in style , and everywhere attractive . From his immense mass of materials , his selections have been wisely made . We think no one will be offended at his admiration for his father 's character , and we are sure that the dignity and spirit of the narrative will conciliate all readers . * The Legislature of Vermont chose the Madisonian electors . " The people , if allowed to vote , would have voted for Clinton . " - p. 461. // It is evident that Governor Plumer was not a man of genius ; nor is there anything peculiarly brilliant in any of the extracts from his own writings which are here presented to us . But as a man of stern principle , and of that energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this world a thousand times oftener than he leaves it to sudden flashes of inspiration , this self-taught chief magistrate , who " took no counsel with flesh or blood , " - this elector who voted as he chose , and not as his constituents intended , is an admirable illustration of the kind of men who , in a quiet way , have done the most for American institutions . Even the little sketch we have attempted of his life will evince that what he did was not at all insignificant . He was a conscientious man , who showed remarkable efficiency in some very important exigencies , who had great success in doing the duty next his hand , and to whom New Hampshire owes , undoubtedly , a great deal in position and in character . Apart from.the circle of the men of New Hampshire , and of his personal friends , the book will attract interest as a contribution to American political history . Our political history will probably never be accurately written . The changes in our politics are too rapid to make it worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the power . But it seldom has the power . The material is not preserved . When a knot of two or three men get together , weigh different names of statesmen who are unconscious that they are in the balance , or of adventurers who have never thought of themselves as statesmen , and thus determine , long before an election , which man shall be forced upon a great party for its nomination , they leave behind them no record of their combinations . All that history knows is little more than the public knows , that , at the given moment , two or three such combinations of men meet at a presidential convention , and that one of their candidates is offered to the nation , which accepts him or rejects him . Here is a single illustration of the darkness which settles on our political history , mainly because it is not worth while to disturb it . It is only occasionally that a ray of light worth notice is flung upon that darkness . Some such rays , // however , which we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the book before us . The subject of most curiosity , which thus receives elucidation , is the supposed desire of some Northeru men in 1803 - on occasion of the annexation of Louisiana - to establish a separate Northern confederacy . Our older readers will recollect the excitement which was aroused when , in October , 1828 , Mr. Adams , then President , and a candidate for re-election , permitted the publication , in the National Intelligencer , of a statement , that the object of " certain leaders " of the Federalist party in Massachusetts , in 1808 , " was , and had been for several years , a dissolution of the Union , and the establishment of a separate confederacy . " This , he said , he " knew from unequivocal evidence , though not provable in a court of law . " When appealed to by Mr. Otis and others to bring forward this evidence , he declined , but said : " The design had been formed in the winter of 1803 -4 , immediately after , and as a consequence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of fixing upon a military , leader for its execution . The author of the written plan was named to me , - a distinguished citizen of Connecticut . I was told it had originated there , and had been communicated to individuals at Boston , at New York , and at Washington . " This remarkable charge , made by the President of the nation while in office , met with immediate replies from various quarters . In especial , Harrison Gray Otis , and several other of the leaders of the Federalist party in Massachusetts , published an " Appeal to the Country , " - a pamphlet well worth reading even now , - in which they " solemnly disavow all knowledge of such a project , and all remembrance of the mention of it , or of any plan analogous to it , at that or at any subsequent period . " In the midst of these publications Governor Plumer came forward , acknowledged that he was a disunionist himself in 1803 and 1804 , " in favor of forming a separate government in New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those years he was consulted on such a plan by Federalist members of Congress from the New England States . On returning home , however , he had found the great majority // of the well-informed leading Federalists of New Hampshire decidedly opposed to the project , and , " from the partial and limited inquiries he made in Massachusetts , the result appeared nearly similar to that in New Hampshire . " This statement was made by him in a letter to the President , which , with his consent , was printed . It does not , as will be seen , fully substantiate the charge , which indeed was too vague in its terms to admit of full substantiation or refutation . But it led to a private correspondence between President Adams and Mr. Plumer , in which the President stated the grounds of his information , which he had refused to make public . They are found in the following extracts , which comprise all the information as yet published which the President sent to Governor Plumer . Having called on Rufus King , April 8 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I found there sitting , Mr. Timothy Pickering , who , shortly after I went in , took leave and withdrew . Mr. King said to me , " Colonel Pickering has been talking to me about a project they have for a separation of the States , and a Northern confederacy ; and he has also been , this day , talking of it with General Hamilton . Have you heard anything of it at Washington ? " I said I had - much - but not from Colonel Pickering . Adams and Pickering , though colleagues , were not friends . " Well , " said Mr. King , " I disapprove entirely of this project ; and so I have told him ; and so , I am happy to tell you , does General Hamilton . " ' " The preceding extract is from a pamphlet , written by Mr. Adams in 1829 , but not yet published . The following extracts are from his letters to Mr. Plumer , the first dated December 31 , 1828 - " Much of my information , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Connecticut , who disapproved the project , but was , I believe , made acquainted with it in all its particulars . I think , though I am not sure , that it was he who named to me the writer of the plan by which the separation was to be effected , with three alternatives of boundary . 1 . If possible , the Potomac. 2 . The Susquehanna. 3 . The Hudson . That is , the Northern confederacy was to extend , if it should be found practicable , so as to include Maryland . This was the maximum . The Hudson , that is , New England and a part of New York , was the minimum . The Susquehanun , or Pennsylvania , was the middle term . There were moments of weariness and // disgust in my own mind at the errors and vices of Mr. Jefferson 's administration , when I almost despaired of the Union myself . ' " - pp. 303 , 304 . This is all of Mr. Adams 's testimony here brought forward on the subject , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of Mr. Otis and his friends . From Mr. Plumer 's journals and letters near the time , the following statements are given , to the same point . " Under date of November 23 , 1806 , in his journal , the following statement occurs , in a notice of Aaron Burr . It is given as an instance of Burr 's art in producing an impression on others , without committing himself hy an express statement of his own opinions . " In the winter of 1804 , Timothy Pickering , James Hilihouse , myself and others dined with him ( Burr ) one day . Mr. Hillhouse unequivocally declared that it was his opinion that the United States would soon form two distinct and separate governments . On this subject , Mr Burr conversed very freely ; and the impression made on my mind was , that he not only thought such an event would take place , but that it was necessary that it should . To that opinion I was myself then a convert . Yet , on returning to my lodgings , after critically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily implied his approbation of Mr. Hillhouse 's observations . Perhaps no man 's language was ever so apparently explicit , and , at the same time , so covert and indefinite . ' " This extract relates principally to Burr , whose character was the subject of remark , and but indirectly to Mr. Hullhouse , yet it shows what was his opinion on the subject , at that timc . Another conversation with the latter , on the same day , will be noticed in a subsequent extract . Under date of February 6th , 1809 , he says : When the late Samuel Hunt intimated to me the necessity of receding from the Union , he observed that the work must commence in the State legislatures ; so that those who acted should be supported hy State laws . This he said was the opinion of - , of Urinh Tracy , and of many others . ' I omit the name of one person here introduced , as Mr. Plumer had no personal intercourse with him , and knew his opinions only as reported by others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for many years prominent in the politics of Massachusetts , and whose known opinions and conduct render his views on this question very little doubtful . " - pp. 295 , 296. // nearest the time alluded to , compromises only Burr , whose reputation , by this time , had gone , and that there is no memorandum whatever of the views of other men , made in 1803 , or 1804 . So careful are public men , even in their private journals , of noting the opinions expressed in confidence . Of his own views at that time , however , we have the following notice - " The ratification , ' he says , ( October 20 , 1803 , ) of this treaty and the possession of that immense territory will hasten the dissolution of our present government . The Constitution never contemplated the accession of a foreign people , or the extension of our territory . Our government may be compared to a company in trade . With as much propriety might a new partner be admitted , and the firm changed , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State , formed from without the limits of the original territory , be admitted into the Union , without the preconsent of each of the present States . Adopt this Western world into the Union , and you destroy at once the weight and importance of the Eastern States , and compel them to establish a separate and independent empire . ' " To Oliver Peabody ( January 19 , 1804 ) he gives a glowing picture of the evils suffered by New England , and then asks - " What do you wish your Senators and Representatives to do here ? We have no part in Jefferson , and no inheritance in Virginia . Shall we return to our homes , sit under our own vines and fig-trees , and be separate from slaveholders ? These are serious questions . What is your opinion , and that of the few in whom you can confide ? " - pp. 285 , 286 . IRev . Jedediah Morse , of Massachusetts , wrote to him in the following words - " I can not but hope ' ( February 3d , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will outride the storm that threatens the ruin of our country . If we were peaceably severed from the rest of the United States , with perhaps some other States joined with us , and left to manage our own affairs in our own way , I think we should do much better than we now do . Our empire is growing unwieldy ; and must , I think , erelong break in pieces . Some think the sooner the better . ' " To this Mr. Plumer replied ( March 10th ) - " I hope the time is not far distant , when the people east of the North River will manage their own affairs in their own way , without 45 * // LIFE OF WILLIAM PLUMER. being embarrassed by regulations from Virginia ; and that the sound part will separate from the corrupt . ' " - p. 289 . These extracts comprise all the intimations of a distinct expression of a desire for disunion , written at or near the time referred to , which are here published . We do not include among them passages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At a later period , when Governor Plumer 's attention was recalled to this matter by President Adams 's charge against " certain leaders of the Federalist party in Massachusetts , " he made the following entry in his journal : - " There is no circumstance in these publications that surprises me so much as the letter of James Hillhouse . I recollect , and am certain , that , on returning early one evening from dining with Aaron Burr , this same Mr. Hilihouse , after saying to me that New England had no influence in the government , added , in an animated tone , " The Eastern States must and will dissolve the Union , and form a separate government of their own ; and the sooner they do this the better . " I think the first man who mentioned the subject of dismemberment to me was Samuel Hunt , a Representative from New Hampshire . He conversed with me , often and long , upon the subject . But there was no man with whom I conversed so often , so fully and freely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt or hesitation , decidedly in favor of dissolving the Union , and establishing a Northern confederacy . He thought it might be effected peaceably , without a resort to arms ; and entered into a particular detail of the mode of effecting it . Next to Griswold , Uriah Tracy conversed most freely and fully upon this subject . It was he who informed me that General Hamilton had consented to attend a meeting of select Federalists at Boston , in the autumn of 1804 . I do not recollect that he said Hamilton was in favor of the measure ; but I know he said Hamilton bad consented to attend . Tracy said the day for meeting was not appointed ; nor were the persons who were to attend selected ; but that I should be notified of the time , and invited to attend . It was Tracy who , in the session of 1804-5 , informed me that the death of Hamilton had prevented the meeting in Boston ; but , he added , the plan of separation is not abandoned . The three men last named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men with whom I principally conversed on that subject . " One day , in the session of 1804- 5 , I distinctly recollect walking , about two hours , with Timothy Pickering , round the northerly and // easterly lines of the city of Washington ; and on that walk no other person accompanied us . I perfectly recollect his conversing with me at that time , as if he were desirous of saying something to me , which he hesitated to communicate . His manner made such a strong and deep impression on my mind , that I shall never forget it . At length he said , that he thought the United States were too large , and their interests too variant , for the Union to continue long ; and that New England , New York , and perhaps Pennsylvania , might and ought to form a separate government . He then paused , and , looking me fully in the face , awaited my reply . I simply asked him , if the division of the States was not the object which General Washington most pathetically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ; the fear of it was a ghost that , for a long time , haunted the imagination of that old gentleman . " I do not recollect that he afterwards mentioned to me the subject of dismemberment . ' " It should be here observed , that before the date of this conversation Mr. Plumer had himself ceased to be a disunionist . Of Hunt , Mr. Plumer , under date of July 31st , 1831 , says : His object was to divide the United States into two separate independent governments ; the States easterly of Maryland to unite and form a government more energetic and more favorable to commerce than the one which then existed . To effect this object , he corresponded with a considerable number of influential Federalists in various States . ' Under date of June 4,1840 , he says , that Tracy told him , in the winter of 1804 , that he was in favor of the Northern States withdrawing from the Union . ' " On reviewing , this testimony , it may be remarked that there is no direct contradiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The former says , that he knew of no combination or plot to dissolve the Union . The latter , that Hilihouse told him the Eastern States must and would dissolve the Union , and the sooner they did it the better . The one is the avowal of an opinion merely ; the other , the denial of any plan formed to carry that opinion into effect . It is observable that Mr. Pickering , though alive at the Adams controversy , took no part in it . He was not the man to deny any well-considered opinion which he might have entertained , because it would subject him to reproach . Mr. Plumer believed , on evidence which he deemed conclusive , that some other prominent men , several especially in Massachusetts , were concerned in this design , or approved of it ; but they , are not named here , as he had no direct personal communication with them on the subject . " - pp. 298-301. // These extracts are curious , though they add little to our knowledge of the supposed intrigue . It may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his letter to Mr. Otis and others , argues , with some care , to show that such a plan , if entertained , embraced " no overt act of treason . " It contemplated resistance to the annexation of Louisiana ; but it was the general confession , that that annexation was unconstitutional ; and a citizen , by the abstract theory of our government , owes no obedience to an unconstitutional law. * Arguing thus , Mr. Adams is , of course , eager to show that he did not think that the annexation justified secession . It is clear from the letters brought forward , that , as in every crisis in our country , there were those who considered this a question worth discussion . As yet , however , there is no evidence , brought forward in detail , that this discussion resulted in any digested scheme . We are not without hopes that the publication of these passages of old correspondence may bring forward more ; but we are disposed to believe that it will prove that there is little more to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need have been pained at the duty of bringing forward these passages from his father 's diaries and letter-books . There is no reason why any one should be disturbed by their publication . Indeed , as we have said , very little appears in them which had not already been made public . As he justly remarks , the whole chapter is instructive . By way of introducing all this old correspondence , he reviews with singular success the early history of the Union , and brings together a surprising mass of authorities , which show how freely public men in all sections then spoke of a proposed severance of it . It would seem to be more remarkable if a leading man of those days had not threatened disunion than to find that he had . We are willing to own that the study of this chapter has given to us a decided feeling of satisfaction , resulting from this very circumstance . It seems to us to teach that this Union of States - the greatest Peace Society which the sun ever looked upon - is more strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To find that it was gravely denounced and bitterly threatened in its infancy , when scarce any ties of interest and affection were twisted in with those of the Constitution , - that it survived threat and denunciation , and gained that power which in later times we have seen , controlling men 's political speculations , and winning their sentimental loyalty , - all this makes one hope that it may yet survive the dangers which bid timid prophets cry , " Ruin , " and that our children may write of the disaffections of 1856 as indifferently as we do of those of 1803 . We intentionally confine our extracts from this curious and interesting memoir to those which illustrate this single subject . There are , however , many other points of historical and of local interest illustrated in it . The book renews our old impressions of the genius and graceful literary power of the author . Governor Plumer appears in it less as a man of commanding talent , than as the careful and successful lawyer , the diligent student , the faithful legislator and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own work , all the gifts of genius which , with filial regard , he could claim for his father . He has made a most attractive book , - attractive for its easy style , for its tender and affectionate spirit , for the completeness with which its details are wrought out , and the skill with which they are set in order . It was a labor of love , of course ; the reader feels that it was a labor which had become a pleasure ; and that , if Mr. William Plumer , Jr . could have been tempted to undertake any other biography , where his hero had not been a governor nor a senator ,  --  had he written the life of an old woman in the poor-house , - had he studied the history , not of the country , but of some unnamed gore in the mountains , - he would have given to the world a book worth reading , for which it would have gratefully remembered his name . He died September 8 , 1854 , just before completing his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the editor named on the title-page , who has prefixed a short sketch of the life of the son to the biography of the father . Governor Plumer left some manuscripts of an historical and biographical character , which may yet furnish important materials for the student of American history .
