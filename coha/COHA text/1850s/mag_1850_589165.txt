164 Tour to ( lie Caucasus . TOUR TO THE CAIJCASUS. * ALL English authors who have written upon Russia , beheld her government , her institutions , and her people , in the same light as Horace did England , when he ascribed her a position " totally out of the world . " Leigh Hunt , and many others , however , never neglected to recognize one unfailing source of that mighty power , whose Dominus et Deus have blotted out one by one some of the fairest fabrics of national greatness , in the intelligence , the hardihood and vigor of the race . It will strike every reader of this book , that the elements of civilization , and the prospects of the people , are the prominent subjects of the author 's investigation . The mass have no choice in their system of government ; why should they be condemned on account of its existence * Nothing but the steady arm of power is visible , and a resistance of its mandates is the sure precursor of its heaviest influence . Notwithstanding all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antago .. nisms , there stands the Cossack dictating the alliances of Europe . Whatever is good in southern Europe he has imitated-whatever has adorned and illustrated her system of life , he has adopted . Languages , literature and laws , have been no barriers to the inquisitorial zeal of his mental lusts . Next to England in political development , but behind her in real progress , he has subdued the wild Circassian , and laid tribute the labor of the Tartar in his far Crimean fastness ; and now " The Turk is dreaming of the hour When he his knee in suppliance bent Shall tremble at his power . " The political destiny of Russia , and her plan of empire , have not controlled the action of Mr. Ditson 's mind , but a great deal of both is suggested . He writes justly , soundly and beautifully . An amiable , generous and elevating feeling gives weight to his assertions and interest to his persons , topics and impressions . There are some pictures in the work , such as a Vatican ramble might recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there are others well suited to the native disorderliness and wildness of the scenes and places which he visited . The author 's observations call up in the mind new visions of social life , which delight , instruct , and move . He draws a scene in a Georgian house , which surprises us as much for the luxurious ricliiiess and refinement it sets forth , as from the fact that it grew into existence under the shadow of those institutions which have provoked an absoluteness of judgment as absolute as the system of life itself . The feeling , hospitality , and generosity , which he encountered from these " Northern Bears , " favor the presumptions that if they are disposed to bite the stranger abroad , they lick his hand at their own door . // On his way up the remote Phasis , the tourist meets a specimen of " beauty unadorned , " as sacred in its chastity as Venus ere she arose from the dominion of the deep . The journey was fraught with fatigue , with sleepless nights and anxious days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female loveliness as to touch every feeling of the impassioned soul . What is to be the destiny of this wide spi*ead realm ? We see now subjected to the power of a single will a splendid galaxy of nations ; all the elements of greatness are there . The high-spirited Pole and the strong-souled Hungarian  --  the beautiful Georgian  --  the turbulent and fearless Cossack  --  the brave and unconquerable Circassian . What should keep Russia from the standard of national perfection ? Only one thing ; the resistance of that accumulating strength which dwells in the might of a more universally developed intelligence . The mass will become more demonstrative than their rulers , and she will yield to that necessity of change which belongs to the reasoning progress of the world . But ere that time arrives , she will probably become the greatest power that ever developed the physical energies of man . In common with all other writers , Mr. Ditson endows the Russian character with aptness , ingenuity and intelligence , all united to remarkable powers of endurance . He is fertile in expedients , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hands of his Father the Emperor . Invade his soil , and he will show you that the freedom of his barren territory is dearer to him than the splendid cities which it cost hundreds of thousands of lives to erect and adorn . We have looked through these pages , so fruitful of accurate observation , with gratification ; inasmuch as the author is the first American who ever visited this remote part of the world . The spirit of the work is admirable ; the writer was enabled to fix his eye on wonders which only Europeans have hitherto beheld , and the impressions he eonveys to us are as vivid and fresh as his own . He commenced his tour with an evident mood for any fate , and his philosophy never forsakes him . If the accommodations of a Circassian village , or Tartan tent , were poor , he was reminded that under their cheerless roofs the forms of men and women grew into fairer physical proportions than those that dwell in the marble palaces of England or France . A beautiful woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embellishment of the table than well dressed poultry , be it ever so celestial . A little more incident would in some measure relieve the tameness of this book . We are no advocates of writing an account of a tour like a serial romance ; but the deepest profundity and the highest wisdom must now undergo the popularizing process . Brilliancy will dazzle if it will not convince ; and all jewellers will tell us that the gem is enhanced in value from its fine setting . One could have wished , too , that all of the author 's journal might have been given to the world embellished with drawings of monuments , ruins , scenery and costume . It is not anticipating too much , we are sure , in believing that the success of this volume will induce its writer to carry out his original design . The publishers have done their duty , for the book is beautifully printed . The fine letter.press and handsome binding are no small recommendations to the body , which contains the soul of an American book . Our commendations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tour to the Caucasus , " and // if they are too laudatory the author is to blame . With any species of desnotism we have no sympathy , nor do we wish to make " The worse appear the better reason but the truth will bear its own weight . We commend the book , for next to the pleasure of reading its contents , is that of recommending them to others . Few merchants offer their merchandise for sale , or commend it to the public , without giving samples as a test of its excellence ; and as we have recommended to our readers the merchandise of Mr. Ditson 's mind , we tender the following specimens , not only to secure their patronage for this evidence of his commercial spirit , but to retain their custom for any future offerings of intellectual wealth which he may bring to a similar market . The " article " will be sought for in the present instance , not so much on account of its intrinsic excellence , as from its rareness . It is seldom that we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are accompanied in detail with occasional homely and slip-shod expressions-with a want of learned disqt*isition , and of elaborateness and manifestations of high and original thought-yet the work has real value . Not being the disciple of a school , the author has not sacrificed the accuracy of his observations to a show of pedantry , or to the use of stiffstilted " big words " and foreign idioms . The narrative runs along smoothly and serenely , and is confined to the fixed limit of his subject , and to a comprehensive use of his materials . We offer a few extracts , which , taken in connection , should set the " Tour " floating on the topmost wave of popularity . Our first selection will show and substantiate the truth of our remark made at the beginning of this notice , in relation to the misrepresentalions of tourists . It will be seen that the author takes occasion to correct the ill.founded assertions of both Clark and Spencer : " Bagtchi-Sarai is one of the largest and most interesting towns of the Crimea , though , independent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except the palace of the khans . This notable and very curious edifice , displaying taste , luxury and a peculiar degree of refinement , has won the unbounded admiration of some , and the contempt of others . A Swedish painter showed to me a model of it , which had cost him nearly a year 's labor to make . Charmed with its proportions , elaborate work , gardens , etc. , he accurately measured , drew and painted every portion of it , and then built it in exquisite miniature . It was evident , however , from his enthusiastic description of this truly enticing abode , that his imagination had always peopled its solitary chambers and deserted walks . Through every lattice he sketched , he saw the dark eyes of the fairest of the Tartar princesses ; at every window the curtain was put aside by some delicate hand ; and on every divan a soft and gentle form was reclining , the syiphide of the harem , an embodiment of divinity . The fountains were surrounded by nymphs ; in every bath their most smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marble pavement seemed waiting for their fairy tread . The voice of the moullah he heard sounding sonoroiisly from the top of the minaret , calling to prayers ; and in each bird that hovered among the thousand trees of the gardens , or drank of the crystal waters which everywhere were pouring into their Parian basins , he felt the charm of transmigration , and sought to convince himself , rather than to destroy the illusion , that they were the similitude , and , in truth , the spirit of those fair , frail creatures of the seraglio , whose presence was an intoxicating delight , and whose beauty was a rich perfume to the soul , now revisiting their former haunts . // " How much better it is , when one can invest an old , deserted palace with such pleasing and renovating subjects , than to look upon it as a mere motley collection of wooden buildings , huddled together without harmony or grandeur , and find fault with it because it is not according to preconceived notions of what it should be , regardless of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who would not rather , like Lamartine , travel with the warm glow on the mind which credulousness and a desire of the beautiful often impart , than , like M. Hommaire , be designated to make an accurate measurement of the arid steppes between the Euxine and the Caspian , and find nothing in modern improvements but vandalism ! " The Sarai is in no degree imposing , but is perfectly adapted to a quiet and sumptuous life . The greatest of Russian poets ( Puskin ) has sung its fascinations , and Catherine the Second lodged here on her visit to the Crimea , with Potemkin . But nothing has given it more interest than the residence of the beautiful Countess Potocki , who , for ten years , was a willing , yet weeping , captive of a Mahometan khan , whose ardent love , however , could not efface the remorse of so strange a union , or save her from an early grave . The Oriental character of this palace , even in all its details , has been scrupulously preserved by imperial orders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French traveller who has visited the country , who has not unequivocally asserted , that the Russians do all that lies in their power to efface every vestige of a monument around which clings any halo of antiquity , or that stands a memorial of the religion , power or customs of any former people . 1 will not deny that many an old , rude wall has been made in part subservient to the building of new towns , or that the picturesque temples dedicated to Mahomet have been considered too profane to rear their graceful minarets hard by where Jesus of Nazareth was worshipped ; but I do deny , that they have been removed for the sole purpose of destroying , and not from motives of utility or commendable religious veneration or enthusiasm . As I have said before , the palace of Bagtchi-Sarai , the Alhambra of the Crimea , by the especial care of the imperial families , has preserved its fantastic appearance , even to the gildings and paintings . When Catherine the Second came here , a portion of it was fitted up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceedingly , and she caused an immediate order to be issued for its restoration ; and as the same feelings have possessed her successors , it still represents a chapter in the Arabian Nights ' Entertainments . It was commenced during the reign of Menghfily-Gherai the First , the most illustrious of all the khans who have governed this lovely country . " Bagtchi-Sarai is situated in a romantic glen , through which runs a small stream , the Djourouksou , and is overshadowed by neighbouring cliffs , which supplies her fountains with water and gives an agreeable temperature to her summer heats . It has all the characteristics of a Turkish town ,  --  mosques , chiosks ; low , tiled houses ; narrow dirty streets , much obstructed by dogs and citizens ; and not so much to please as I anticipated when I wrote concerning it in a former chapter . " Here is a portrait sketched with a free pencil . It is a Russian Venus without a pedestal ; the subject has all the purity of marble , without any of its coldness , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " While we were walking the other day under the arches in front of the gratings at the quarantine barrier , we met a young woman of very slender form , pale , but classic face , lit up by large blue eyes full of earnestness and trust . She seemed fitted by nature to bear no burdens , yet she had evidently suffered . Her hair was very neatly dressed beneath her blue velvet cocauchnick , and // showed that much pains had been taken with it , but from her shoulders hung a poor old cloak , while an ordinary gown and shoes that had long been in servicer aided in concealing her scantily clad person . In the folds of her outer garment , she carried an infant , and though it was very small , it seemed too much for her strength . She was walking backwards and forwards along the same platform with us , and watched the different gratings to see if any one appeared there whom she knew , and then she would turn to the passers-by , and when she saw one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquire if a certain vessel had not yet arrived , and ifthe officers would not soon be at the barrier ; but when she saw a man with a stern , calculating visage , she said nothing to him . She however addressed my companion , and on being assured that she might goon expect to see the officers of the vessel , as it had arrived that morning , the happy gushings around her heart flooded her bright eyes . At my suggestion , he asked if she was married ; she replied with a smile that she was to be , as soon as the first officer , whom she was looking for , arrived ; and as she said this she seemed to fold more closely to her breast her little child , doubtless the pledge of their affections . We left her looking through the gratings . To-day , at the hospital , almost beyond the dreams of this world , lay that same delicate form , and the face was more pallid and more emaciated than before . On that morning , when she was waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she learned that he had fallen a victim to the cholera raging at Stamboul . That deep fountain of affection which God has placed in our souls , pouring forth whither it will , watering oft-times the germs of sinful plants , but , nevertheless , within its genial recipients creating the most refined and exalted of earthly beatitude , was now welling up in her struggling bosom and running over into the vast , widespread sterility which surrounded it , and which was soon to absorb it and destroy it forever . I had read in the depth of those azure eyes that intensity of feeling she might never utter , and I can well imagine how such beings can die of desolateness of heart , for there are bat few-such are life 's duties and cares - who can understand , appreciate , and have sympathy with them . Apropos to this " Mr. Heaford related to me the other evening the facts concerning the death of an acquaintance of his , which recently took place . A young girl , a Greek by birth , though educated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiration of the citizens . Among the number was a wealthy and titled Russian , somewhat older than the lady , and of a temperament little suited to hers . He , however , urged his suit , which her own parents much favored , and finally won her consent to an union . I will not follow her through all her struggles against the wild pleadings of a generous heart , wedded in its every pulsation to a youth of her own country-that strife which for weary months she maintained between her filial obligations and her every other emotion and sentiment . She wedded the Russian . Others have acted in the same way , with the idea , or at least the sincere hope . that intimacy will ripen into attachment , and that eventually pleasure will result from the society thus submitted to and encouraged . A few days after the marriage they drove out in their splendid carriage and passed down on to the quay , where my narrator hajpened to be , and so extraordinary was the beauty of the bride , that all the workmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he informed me , delayed their toil to gaze upon her . The admiration of the world , the sincere homage of thousands failed , however , to supply that void in her breast which only one could have filled , and to whom she was now forever lost . The hope which she had cherished now only mocked , and the vista of the life before her , became more dreary than the valley of death . She returned home , and , ascending to the terrace of her dwelling , gazed long toward her father-land , and on the bright light which still lingered about the western horizon . She then descended to the garden and plunged herself into a deep cistern , from which she was taken lifeless . " Our traveller left Odessa in a Russian man-of-war , and his life on shipboard must have been pleasant . The admiral 's lady ( the author is a // favorite with ladies ) was excessively solicitous of his comfort ; the officers were gentlemanly and courteous  --  the band played Verdi 's most beautiful music  --  and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can readily believe from the following remarks : " The admiral extended to me to-day his usual courtesy , and at his table was my pleasant Georgian acquaintance , with his sons . The colonel has urged me strongly to accompany him to his home , taking the circle of the Black Sea , first crossing by land the Crimea , and then running along in the government steamer the entire coast of Circassia , touching at all the different fortresses on our way . He states , also , that I shall be liable to encounter bad subjects on my interior route , besides finding the steppes monotonous and devoid of interest , and has almost persuaded me to be his companion to the capital of Georgia and NewRussia . After dinner , we all went on the upper deck , from which the admiral 's lady pointed out to me , as we approached the harbor , the ruined walls and temples of the ancient city of Chersonesa , which lay on our right . " After we had anchored , the Captain Nukotich , usually a very plainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than six different decorations of honor on his breast , came to me and offered a le*rer of introduction to a friend of his on shore , a Captain Matoosky , who , he said , would be extremely gratified if I would take up my quarters at his house ; - being a bachelor , and living alone , he would find pleasure in showing to me all that was interesting in the region of Savastopol . " Having no acquaintances here , I ; *eadily and gratefully accepted his letter . He then ordered a boat , and provided an officer to accompany and take me to the house of his friend . The admiral came and bade me adieu by a warm pressure of the hand , and I turned away from the ship with feelings of sadness and regret ; for , although a stranger , not knowing a word of the language of the people I was among , and known to them only by casualty , I had received the most frank hospitality and kind attentions , which the truly generous only know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I had heard much of Russian bears and Muscovite boors , and had almost expected to see a Cossack head mounted on every woman 's shoulder ; but what must be the impression left by my first intercourse with this people . The admiral 's lady , with exquisite blandness ( if manners , had manifested those tender sympathies which become a noble-hearted woman . Every officer merited an acknowledgment for well-timed civility and urbanity ; and as it is my desire to do justice to all , independent of any local prejudices , I trust that I shall ever be as ready to portray the good I see , as to follow in the beaten track of descrying all habits , laws , customs , religions , differing from our own . " The account of the antiquities and curiosities of Kertsch , is a very interesting chapter , which we commend to especial attention . These vast subterranean chambers and turmuli are invested with the dim and mysterious light of some older world ,  --  " the first-born of time . " " The Greeks here intermarry with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Russians regard them both with contempt . " Truly are the descendants of that great people which " held the world in awe , " " Greeks , hut living Greeks no more . " Speaking of the Circassian women , the tourist thus descants : " To how many thousands of Circassian maidens has this been the bright surveying point of a brilliant destiny ! To how many at least has it appeared so , when , after traversing the long , rugged ravines of the Caucasus , they have reached the summit*of these neighbouring heights , and have gazed with throbbing breasts on the fair city below them ! The vision of their childhood , the dreams of their girlish days , the aspirations of their riper years , were here // about to have a form , a tangibility , a reality ; - they were to pass from a state of servitude , dependence , and , perhaps poverty , to a life of splendid ease , of enviable independence , luxury and love . Their bright eyes brightening with these happy thoughts , their beauty was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the change . It would , however , be extravagant to say that none were disappointed . Some , doubtless , trusting by their charms to become the " light of the harem , " the mother of a sultan ; to be bedecked with the costliest jewels and wrapped with the richest robes , have rated their fascinations too high , and found themselves but the domestic servants of some miserly crones , who , while they made the arduous tasks of their gentle captives repay them for their cost , begrudged it while they toiled , Some , too , whom God createrl with nervous temperaments , and endowed from birth with refined , sensitive , delicate feelings , ( and there are such by nature among every people ) - led from their poor but happy hearth stones , and from the affectionate care of parents , believing that the world was all bright , and that the smiles and caresses of strangers would repay them for the sundering of the ties of home ,  --  finding not a shadow of those warm and ardent sympathies , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold , chilling realities of life , with which the mass by adaptation are to combat ; - some too , I say , thus endowed , doubtless have welcomed their premature graves , literally made desolate-hearted . " Every one will naturally ask if this traffic has ceased . As far as Anapa and all other Russian ports are concerned , I am authorized to say it has . Yet I am aware that the transportation of Circassian maidens to Constantinople is a thing of almost daily occurrence , and can not be restrained . Several hundred , on their way to the great capital , have been captured within a few years . These are probably a very small portion of the number who embarked . They were taken in Turkish vessels  --  the Circassians having none of their own  --  and were distributed as convenience dictated . " In destroying this trade , the Russians have only one object in view , though in their policy there may appear a sublime virtue  --  the suavis of humanity and religion ; for it is generally supposed that these girls thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bonds with the same anguish of heart as do the negroes of Africa ; - that in going to Constantinople they remain Mahometans , whereas if they are taken by the Russians they will more readily become members ,  - -  or their children will ,  --  of the Greek church . " The fact is , this bondage referred to above , and with which we associate all that is abject , degrading and heart-rending , in reality is divested of such features , and is in truth the fairest vision which floats before the imagination of these youth . The parents look forward to the time when their children shall be purchased and settled in Constantinople , with precisely the same feelings , hopes , and anticipations , as the New-England farmer and his family look on the promising son , who goes to some great capital to become a merchant and rich man . The Caucassian parents have , too , the same reasons for releasing their children as those in America , who , though sprung from indifferent sources in the country , have made for themselves wealth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various times , having been raised to the highest posts in the Ottoman Empire . The mothers of the Sultan , and of the admiral of the Turkish fleet , are Caucassian slaves , and they receive all the honors due to their present exalted station . I shall have occasion doubtless to refer to this subject again , after I have seen more of this remarkable people in their own homes. ** The picture of a Caucassian family , commencing at page 250 , we wish we had space to introduce here , on account of the insight it give* us into the modes and habits of the life of people upon whom nature has bountifully bestowed every gift of physical affluence and beauty . We close these extracts with an account of the character of a Russian nobleman , and it is no less a person than the prince to whom the work is dedicated . It would be in vain , we imagine , to look either in France , England , Spain . // or Italy , for an example of purer hospitality , higher generosity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encountered within the walls of Prince Woronsoff 's palace : " The Princess Woronsoff , a daughter of the celebrated Countess Braniska , whose immense fortune was unequaled in Russia , has a very fair complexion , and is handsome . She is of middling height , full form , and looks about thirtyfive years of age , though I believe she is somewhat older . her taste in dress suited well her figure , and her pleasing expression gave a youthful tinge to all that she did . She wore a lace cap trimmed with a white and delicate red ribbon . It sat well back on the head , and showed her fine dark hair , which , in a broad mass , was brought low on each cheek , and passed under the ears . Her frock was of dark green plaid silk , with a waist open in front , where a stomacher was partly concealed by a broad satin ribbon that fastened about the neck a small lace collar . Over her shoulders was carelessly thrown a white satin scarf ; and on her left wrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string of corals with a golden pendant . On her delicate hand she had one large turquoise , and several diamond rings , " The Prince Woronsoff , not being well , suffering much from an affection of the eyes , dined in his private room , to which , when dinner was over , we all retired , the princess leading the way . The prince , to show the courtesy due to a stranger , and express his particular regard for one of the Saxon race , speaking English , of which he is very fond , came forward to welcome me , passing by his generals with only a bow . He cordially extended his hand , then led me to a seat beside himself and the princess . He asked me at once how I liked the Crimea , as he knew I had passed through it ; but , said he , " you did not see the best part of it-you should see the southern coast , which is very beautiful . " I told him 1 had traversed the interior for the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a view of his estate alone , was well worthy of a journey around the whole peninsula . We then entered into conversation concerning the improved state of commerce in the Black Sea ; and when I told him of the quantity of grain that had been exported within nine months from Odessa , he replied-making some calculations-that he believed it to be even more , evidently conversant with the prosperous state of the agricultural interest . He then asked if I came up the Phasis ; and said that next year , or year after , he should have tug-boats there , so that passengers could come up to Mar*ne in two days , and that , as soon as practicable , he should have steamers ; but wished to know if I thought there were not too many bars and snags in the stream for such an enterprise . I admitted to him that the impediments were innumerable , but doubted not that the same sagacity which had spread so many steamers over the Euxine , would succeed there ; and acknowledged , in answer to a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful . " Yes . said he , " it will be the garden of New-Russia . " He then , with an expression of pleasure , referred to my own country-saying : " The Americans appear now to be in quiet possession of Mexico . " I replied , that I had received no news since their approach to the capital . " Yes , " said he , " it is so ; and I will loan to yoa the papers which affirm it ; " and he immediately rose , went to his drawer and brought four numbers of the London Morning Post , last date November 6th . He said I might take them with me , and return them on the next day , as he had not read them all . He then continued the subject , showing a most intimate knowledge of all the movements of our army-of every hattle that had been fought-of the names of all who had distinguished themselves , and mentioned in terms of high praise , Generals Taylor and Scott-adding : " Your soldiers are of the same hardy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this venerable , this distinguished warrior , statesman and prince , entertained me during the evening , displaying such a profundity of accurate , practical knowledge , on all subjects on which his giant intellect rested , adorned and embellished by the most mild and urbane manners , that when I took my leave of him , it was with a degree of veneration I had never felt towards any other man . // " The princess smoked ! Immediately after dinner , her page brought in a rich Turkish pipe , set it on the floor , unfolded the long flexible stem , and presented its amber mouth-piece to the lady . She took it in her jeweled hand , gave a few graceful whiffs , and then returned it to the page . She seemed to enjoy it , was evidently accustomed to it , and it was the only thing I saw about her that was in bad taste-one that I could not but heartily condemn . It is bad enough for men to fill their pockets and mouths , and scent their whole person with tobacco ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elegantly dressed lady , " as Buiwer would say , is thus destroyed , half of her power and the divinity of that celestial halo of purity which encircles her like a tiara of pearls , vanishes . The princess 's page is a good looking youth , very differently dressed from the other attendants-something in the Hindoo style . " Coffee had been handed round by servants ; but a dwarf , a very short , curious looking little man , with large mustaches , came to receive the cups . When the princess had finished smoking , she called to her a little animal that had been skipping about the room , and it leaped upon her from a great distance . She remarked to me that it was a great pet of hers , and that it had been brought to her from Affghanistan . It resembled the African squirrels I had seen , but it was about three times as large . " Prince Kotsohobey , in accordance with a promise last evening , called this morning and presented to inc a splendid Russian map of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ceremony  --  the consecration of the army . The patriarch in robes of golden cloth officiated . The officers in full uniform were present , and received his benediction after many formalities , and reading from a massive Bible bound in gold . The patriarch then went out , and with a small brush sprinkled with holy water the soldiers drawn up in front of the church . " Sunday being inclement , I devoted myself to the study of the Russian language . On Monday , met the Princess Bebutoff , and soon after received an invitation from the Princess Woronsoff to attend a ball that evening , at the palace . A drosky took me there at eight o'clock , and I was received in the grand saloon by the princess , who wore the charms of her sweetest smiles , 7and her most affable manners . General Sofonoff and lady soon arrived . The latter and Princess Woronsoff were in dark satin dresses in French style . That of lady Woronsoff was cut pointed in the neck before and behind , and trimmed with ruffles of fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair brought full and low on the chee1*s , ornamented on one side by a fringe of black bugles , and on the other by a small delicate feather , which floated gracefully beside the glossy braids . On the neck was a single string of pearls . The rest of the company was made up of glittering officials , and short and tall women , dressed according to their good or bad tastes . One very little woman had three enormous crimson dahlias in her hair , and four on the front of the skirt of her dress , but she had a pleasant face , innocent as the light . There were two in Georgian costume ; one , the Princess Parlavaodoff , was pretty and fairy-like . Her dress was of pearl colored silk , made like those I have heretofore described . Around her waist was a ribbon of the color of her chemisette , and on her arm , covered by a long sleeve , were two bracelets , one of gold and one of coral . Her front hair was brought low on the cheeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , partly covered by the thin veil that floated from her little golden cap . " Khanikoff , an author of much celebrity here . extended to me his acquaintance , and presented me to Count De Lille . companion of Count Courtigie , employed by the French government to make observations on the military establishments of the country , in reference to adopting the same in Africa . Tea and cake were handed around , then commenced a gallopade , which was followed by quick waltzes-couples succeeding each other , after passing up and down the hall once ; it being considered somewhat improper to extend a waltz further , with the same partner . Ice creams and sherbet were next brought , and the // dwarf came to receive the dishes . The ladies were then all seated at the upper end of the hall , and Mons. iRodolf , a distinguished French professor of legerdermain , went through a series of sleights of hand that astonished all . " Mons. R. was three years in Constantinople by the wish of the Sultan , who made him many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and has with him a sweet little Italian wife . After his feats the mazurka was danced for an hour ; but it had nothing of the bewitching grace , that true poetry of motion which characterizes the Spanish waltzes as danced by the Madridleninns . One is the graceful roll of the ship at sea , the other , the feather in a whirlwind . In the morning , M. Khaniko.ff favored me with a call and a book to read . Baron Nicolaif came , and entertained me for two hours , and in the evening I had a visit from a Mr. Ivanhoe , a Greek from Smyrna , who knew many of my old acquaintances there  --  the lovely Greek sisters , the Misses Gou , one of whom , ( and whose portrait is in her father-in-law 's family in the United States , ) is now the wife of an estimable American , Mr. Langdon ; the worthy English family of Purdys , one of whom married a charming and wealthy lady of Boston ; the Messrs . Offleys of Philadelphia , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Lord , adorns the society of Trinidad de Cuba . " Early this morning I received a note of invitation from Princess and Prince Woronsoff , to dine with them in the evening . By invitation I paid a visit also to the Georgian Princess Bebutoff , it being with her a marriage jete day . I entered a large walled courtyard , ascended a long , low flight of steps , to the stylobate of a handsome one-story wooden house , of light green color . Passing through a long hall , I was received at the door of the reception-room by the Princess ' brother , who presented me formally to his sister , who was reclining on a divan beside her mother . As I kissed the hands of the good lady and lovely daughter , they returned the compliment by kissing my hair ; this species of salutation being allowable where persons are intimate ; and the long acquaintance I had had with the Princess ' father and brothers , and the knowledge we possessed , consequently , of each other , made her , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , when I was so seriously injured by the upsetting of the carriage , appear more like a relative than a stranger . The young lady , gorgeously attired in native costume , arose to receive me , while her parent sat a La Georgian . The room was large , and richly furnished in blue damask . On one side , covering about a quarter of the finely waxed floor , was a large Persian rug , on which stood a sofa and centre-table , and opposite it a piano . I had been invited here to dine , but a previous engagement at the palnce prevented what would have been very agreeable ; but I was not permitted to leave without promising to return again , after I had left Prince WoronsoiL The Princess would not , therefore , say to me pdieu , but , au revoir . I shall not soon forget the tone of that voice ; and the smile that accompanied it , is a delicate wreath hung up in my memory . " I next drove to Prince Kotsohobey 's to return his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , however , met there . Prince Dinderdoff. who invited me to his apartments , where he displayed some very excellent raw silk , made in the neighborhood , and which is becoming a great article of commerce . I was astonished to find that he was perfectly conversant with the detailed movements of our army , and said that he thought that General Scott must be a great military chief , while General Taylor deserved the thanks which one state refused to vote to him , and the highest honors in the gift of our government . He also mentioned , in terms of admiration , Bragg . Worth , Ringgold , Hunter , and many others , several distinguished sons of Massachusetts ; and affirmed that it was incredible how the untutored volunteer corps should fight so bravely , and be so hold and irresistible . It was most gratifying to me to see that the fame tf those noble-hearted soldiers had thus sprcad over the world . "                    @
