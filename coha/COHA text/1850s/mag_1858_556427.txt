txt ART . X. The Biographical History of Philosophy , from its Origin in Greece down to the Present Day . By GEORGE HENRY LEWES . Library Edition , much enlarged and thoroughly revised , in two volumes . New York : ID . Appleton &amp; Co. 18*37 . THE study of the history of philosophy , when pursued by means of abstracts and generalizations , must , from the nature of things , be to a certain degree unsatisfactory . Philosophers are in general close writers , as well as close thinkers . A thinker who has spent years in elaborating a system , and at last publishes it to the world , free from those rounded proportions and that outside adornment which swell the bulk of works designed to attract and to gratify the unthinking crowd , does ot ordinarily say in a volume what may be as well said in a few pages . What abstract , for instance , can do any justice to the chain of reasoning by which Kant binds the soaring spirit of man within the darkness of his scepticism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth again into the free air and sunshine ? And if this difficulty is experienced in regard to a merely critical philosophy , it is felt even more strongly in those that are constructive . A mere generalization is most unsubstantial fare . We // need to see the slow process by which it attains its growth , and absorbs all things into its own nature . We can scarcely read an original work of this class , however much we may dissent from the final result at which it arrives , without gaining a new insioht into the nature and connection of things . b The difficulty of obtaining a knowledge of such works by mere abstracts is of course more felt in regard to the comparatively later than to the earliest philosophers , partly on account of the greater simplicity of the earlier systems , partly because in regard to them the whole world suffers together . By a glance at one of these we can perhaps better understand the difficulty of which we speak . We will take as an example Thales . All that can be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all things is water . Nothing can seem more absurd , at the first glance , than this assertion , made thus boldly . This solid earth , the green trees , our own frames , seem by their very presence to belie it . Yet , if we should consider , in detail , all the facts by which it might be supported , and should compare these with the all-embracing generalizations of the Neptunian theory in modern geology , we should admire the broad grasp of the reason of Thales , rather than ridicule his simplicity . But this single sentence , which we have quoted from him , bears a much greater proportional relation to the speculations and observations to which we have referred , than do the abstracts of the systems of later philosophers , given in the common histories , to the systems themselves ; and the difficulty in the former ease is so much less considerable , as the connection of the thoughts in the latter is more concealed and intricate . The matter is made worse by the fact that historians in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosopher , instead of their result . What we want is what the Germans call his Weltanscltauung* . The historian should have imagination enough to place himself upon the stand-point of the philosopher he would describe , and , instead of leading his reader among skeletons of arguments , and ghosts of ideas , and huge systems of terminology , which are to him almost as bare of meaning as they *vi1l ever be useless for application , he should construct the world as beheld from this position . This , if it // were skilfully done , as in many eases it might be , would at once interest and instruct the reader ; and if afterward he might wish to climb the height and see for himself , there could be no better course suggested to him than the intricate labyrinth which the author of the system has followed out , and of which he alone can furnish the clew . We know not whether the histories of philosophy , that succeed one another so rapidly , do not owe their existence as much to the lack of satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other cause . Men have a desire to look into these philosophic mysteries . Each work that promises to aid them in this fails either to interest or to instruct them as they wish , and thus they demand ever new manuals . The work whose title is placed at the head of this article can less than any other , perhaps , be accused of dulness . The writer is lively and pleasant . Where others would put their readers to sleep , he amuses them , so far as the subject will admit , with his vivid fancy . This pleasantness , however , is in part owing unfortunately to a certain flippancy , which would be less objectionable were it merely on the surface . It seems , however , to extend into the thought , or rather to spring from it . Thus the philosopher , whose deep and intricate reasoning would almost appall any other writer who found himself forced to communicate an idea of it in brief , and who might perhaps only bewilder the reader by his attempts , causes no difficulty to Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and leads him forth to amuse the crowd by a sort of ground and lofty tumbling . This exhibition is greeted by laughter , instead of yawns , and doubtless the exhibitor congratulates himself on his success . It is unfortunate that Mr. Lewes had not selected a field in which his peculiar talents would have been more appropriate . In works merely scientific , if he had wished , and had turned his studies in that direction , he might have done something to enlighten the popular mind . In studies relating to the literature and the thought of France he might have made himself especially at home . But , unluckily , he has devoted himself to labors to which his irreverent and superficial habits of thought are especially unfitted , namely , philosophy and German literature . // We are glad to see that the new edition of his History of Philosophy is less marked by that flippant conceit of which we have spoken , than the first . While he still boasts that he is the only person who ever undertook to write a history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he no longer claims this as the only proper stand-point for undertaking such a work . While he still does not hesitate to attempt an analysis of the system of Hegel , he does not claim any longer the peculiar honor of being the only person who has undertaken to show how it grew up in the mind of its author , and this without understanding its first principles . While the work is thus improved in some respects , it has not , we regret to say , gained to a corresponding extent in depth and insight . The distinction between science and philosophy was much more correctly stated in the earlier edition than in the present . The author starts , as has been intimated , from the principle that a true philosophy is impossible . We certainly have no fault to find with this position . It is the one more commonly held by the world , and a writer occupying it is to be respected for the respectability of his constituency , if for no other reason . It is also the view most naturally taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether in philosophy or r*digion . He sees sects and parties that appear in direct op position to one another . Each claims to hold the truth . If either is right , it would seem to imply that all the others are wrong . The simplest way , then , is to afilrmn that all are wrong . Not till one has reached the central idea in either case , and seen how all grow out of it , and serve for the development of it , can this position be opposed with any show of reason . A candid expression of opinion is to be welcomed from all parties , especially when supported by sound argument and learning . If Mr. Lewes occupied simply this position , his work should be hailed as the first formal representative of it . If his position were controverted , it would be simply a free and honorable discussion . But when a writer , instead of merely announcing his lack of faith in that philosophy of which he is to give the history , starts with the most imperfect and fluctuating notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he fails to perceive in their truth those distinctions which meet him at the very threshold ; when he shows himself unable to grasp the thought of some of the most important writers of whom he treats ; when he evinces a disposition to hold up as ridiculous what he can not understand ; when he thus ridicules works which he has never read save in part , and this part only carelessly ; and when he supports this ridicule by gross mistranslation , - the case is changed . Such is the position which we charge Mr. Lewes with occupying , which charge it will be the principal object of the following pages to maintain . It is first to be inquired , What idea does Mr. Lewes attach to the word philosophy ? He acknowledges the propriety of this question , and informs us that he wishes to attach to it the same meaning which it bears in all other histories . He therefore defines it as metaphysics , in opposition to science . He subsequently includes psychology under the same head , where it properly belongs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made . On the same page he writes : " Vainly do some argue that Philosophy has made no progress hitherto , because its problems are so complex , and require more effort than the simpler problems of Science . " ( p. xii . ) Here it is distinctly intimated that the problems of philosophy are essentially different from those of science . On a subsequent page we read as follows : " The heights and depths of man 's nature , the heights to which he aspires , the depths into which he searches , and the grander generalities on Life , Destiny , and the Universe , find as eminent a place in Science as in Philosophy , with the simple difference , that they are less vague and are better founded . " ( p. xiv . ) All questions relating to God and the soul belong certainly to metaphysics . The moment we approach such subjects , we leave the domain of science , as Mr. Lewes defines it . He himself says : " To aspire to the knowledge of more than phenomena , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to aspire to transcend the inexorable limits of human faculty . " ( p. xii . ) God is certainly not a phenomenon ; yet a knowledge of him is certainly the highest to which man aspires , and therefore must be included in the splendid promise quoted above . // Mr. Lewes 's remonstrance , when a thought of this seems to cross his mind , reminds us of the reply that Mephistopheles made to Faust 's first demand , after he had pledged himself to satisfy all his wants . Mr. Lewes writes , a few lines below those last quoted : " If we can not reach certain heights , let us acknowledge them to be inaccessible , and not deceive ourselves and others by phrases which pretend that these heights are accessible . " In relation to science and philosophy Mr. Lewes writes : " The object of both is the same , namely , Explanation of all phenomena . Their characteristic differences , therefore , do not lie in the thing sought , so much as in the Method of search . " ( p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that maintained in his first edition . He goes on to illustrate this alleged distinction by a twofold attempt to explain the phenomena of table-tipping ; the metaphysical method being to assign some fanciful cause , without supporting its position by proof ; while the scientific method subjects everything to careful experiment . We have thus collected scattered remarks of Mr. Lewes , which may serve to illustrate his view of the distinction between scienc9 and philosophy . Let us look back upon them , and see what we have obtained . In the earlier quotations he intimates distinctly that their problems are of a different nature . On page xiv . he asserts them to be the same ; which assertion is quickly withdrawn , as soon as it is seen to lead to undesirable consequences . In the passage last cited , he again aflirms them to be the same , and this time holds his position . It is certainly a safer one for science than the one which he relinquished ; for in that he had raised science to the heights of philosophic thought ; while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific inquiry . He has before rightly stated that psychology is a part of metaphysics , and had admitted that the study of it had been pursued , at least in part , in the scientific method , to which it had been indebted for its progress . Now we read that science and philosophy differ only in their method . To which field , therefore , does psychology belong ? We have already said that Mr. Lewes began his History with an imperfect and fluctuating // against the charges we had just made ; and no less , to show that these charges are not invalidated by our defence . This is not a mere question of words . It makes very little difference in what sense a man uses them , provided he make that sense clear , and stand to it . But when a writer undertakes to give an entirely new view of any subject , the first question is , not whether it be the right view , but whether it be any clear view at all . If he undertakes to treat of subjects which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice if , in the very first question that arises , one indeed which he himself has started , he becomes confused , contradicts himself , and leaves no decided conception in the mind of the reader except that of his own want of any . If one should employ a guide , who had promised to lead him to the place whither he would go , by a new and safe route known only to himself , it would make some difference whether , on starting , he should first turn to the east , and then to the west , uncertain which direction to take . It would at least show his own incapacity for the business before him . To illustrate more fully the imperfection of his notion of what philosophy is , let us examine a little more closely that into which he settles down at last . It is the explanation of phenomena , - such phenomena as table-tipping . He selects this example as one particularly appropriate , because the scientific explanation is fully established ; yet what he calls the metaphysical explanation has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is still so generally maintained , that the reader can enter into the spirit of it without difficulty . What he assumes as the metaphysical explanation consists in this , - " that it is an hypothesis started , and taken for granted without being proved by experiment . " The theory which is based on the interference of disembodied spirits , and that which assumes the phenomena in question to be caused by electricity , are alike brought under the head of metaphysical . What he calls the scientific explanation is , that the movements in question are produced by involuntary muscular action . It is called scientific , because it is based upon careful experiment . Mr. Lewes , as we have before seen , expresses the same anxiety to use the word philosophy , in the // sense in which it is used in other histories , as M. Jourdain in the play of Moli*re did to dress and to conduct in all respects like the quality ; and he is about as successful . We think he would find no history of philosophy in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation of particular phenomena by finite causes . If science has any realm , it is precisely this . If the causes are assumed too freely , and without proper investigation , they do not on this account belong to philosophy or metaphysics . They constitute imperfect science . Or rather they bear the same relation to science , which the dreams of some wild enthusiast do to philosophy . They may be counterfeits ; but whatever they are , it is science that must suffer from them . Philosophy has to do with far different subjects . The objects of its study are God , spirit , freedom , the world as an organic whole . These it does not take singly , but in their relations to one another . The form under which it contemplates them is that of necessity . It is not at variance with science , but it uses its results freely , and absorbs them into itself . If it has anything to do with particular phenomena , it is when it can regard them as the results of the absolute world-system . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Mr. Lewes ascribes to it , namely , the explanation of phenomena . This is a distinction which he connot appreciate . He compares the certainty with which the philosopher speaks of the objects such as have been referred to , which are visible only to the intuition of reason , with the confidence with which some dreamer might speak of his conceptions of the nature of the inhabitants of Sirius . He does not comprehend that the one speaks of that which forms the groundwork of his own being , and which the eye turned inward , if not already blinded by the glitter of the outward world , could hardly fail to discern ; and the other , of the outward peculiarities of beings most unlike himself . We have referred to this subject , not to give a definition of philosophy , but to illustrate the sense in which , with only minor differences , it is used in the works which Mr. Lewes would imitate , and to show by contrast the difference between this and the meaning which Mr. Lewes assigns to it . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // for he uses the terms as synonymous , is well fitted to support him in the assertion , that the course of science is always onward , while that of philosophy is circular . All explanations of phenomena which are not thoroughly proved , he calls metaphysical . Any such explanation which turns out to be false can not have been thoroughly verified ; therefore , as soon as any scientific assertion is at last seen to be ungrounded , it at once passes from the realm of science into that of philosophy . Thus philosophy is burdened , not only with its own blunders , but with those of science also ; and science is as infallible as the Pope . This is the only view by which the infallibility of science can be maintained . Take , for instance , the various positions of science in regard to light . First , we have the corpuscular theory ; but shortly the existence of light corpuscles is denied , light is affirmed to be an ether pervaiding the universe , and the effect of light is produced by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold generalizations in regard to the correlation of forces , science seems on the point of ignoring even ether . The same is true in regard to electricity . The existence of the electrical fluid seemed established , if anything was ; but now doubt is thrown even over this . Light and electricity , heat and magnetism , seem about to lose their existence as distinct entities , and to be brought together as mere modifications of one pervading force . This example , in which doubt is seen to be cast by science itself on what is still generally regarded as established by science , may serve as an example to offset Mr. Lewes s table-turning , which occupies the same intermediate position between that which is proved and that which is still doubtful . It may be said that the changes in science result in general from the progress from a narrower to a broader generalization , as its circle of facts becomes enlarged . But the same is true of philosophy ; only its progress is more regular , being from within outward , and not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previous philosophies into his system ; Plato again summed up those of the philosophers that had gone before him ; and Hegel adopts all with more minuteness as moments into his own system . That absolute identity which formed the basis of the utterance of // LEWES 'S HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY . Thales , and which was more clearly stated by the Eleatics , forms also the basis of the latest system . Principles which seem most opposed to one another , such as the absolute identity of Spinoza , and the absolute diversity of Leibnitz , both find themselves adopted into a higher generalization , where their hostility is lost . Thus the same questions continually reappear , as Mr. Lewes has stated ; but it is as the cotyledons of the seeds of a plant reappear in the young leaves , the structure of the leaves in the flower , the divisions of the flower in the fruit . Thus the line of progress is not a circle , but a spiral . For this progress the negative element is necessary . Thought is infinite ; but particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the spirit may attain to its highest development , so systems must perish , that the thought may pass on to higher spheres . And as the Church has taught that these bodies shall not be left for ever , but shall be raised , and glorified , and enter with the spirit into its purer state of being ; so is it with these systems which have been cast aside ,  --  the absolute thought still bears them with it , freed from their grossness and finiteness , as it presses onward in its free development . There must therefore be the element of negation , which shall do for them what death does for the body . Such are the periods of scepticism , through one of which we seem to be even now passing . Even in Germany , which has so long been the philosophic centre of Christendom , the national thought seems turned in a different direction . We have seen one of the most profound of the followers of Hegel , one of the four who formed the first class which listened to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berlin ; and have then seen the throngs of students , which the largest lecture-room could scarcely contain , listening eagerly to the revelations of modern chemistry . If this were the first period of scepticism which the world had beheld , there might indeed be doubt whether this apparent death were not an eternal sleep . But at present philosophy could be served in no better manner than by this enlargement of the sphere of science . Notwithstanding all that science has done , it is still a crude // 2*3 mass of facts , - crude , when compared with that perfect generalization which is demanded for the purposes of philosophy . Thus must the alternations of the past be repeated in the future . But when science shall have perfectly subdued the world , then shall philosophy finally awake , and absorb its results into itself . No longer coldly reasoning , it shall be fired with Christian love ; and science , philosophy , and religion shall become blended , as body , soul , and spirit , into one . Thus are scepticism as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow-workers for the perfecting of the race . These remarks may suffice with reference to Mr. Lewes 's general position in regard to philosophy . We think that it is in regard to the later German philosophies that a book like the one which we are at present considering vill be most consulted . Owing to the peculiar stand-point which these occupy , it has been found difficult for the English and American reader to enter profoundly into their spirit . This difficulty increases that to which we have already referred , as inherent in all histories of philosophy . But the systems of which we speak are precisely those in regard to which Mr. Lewes 's book is least worthy of confidence . The relation between the pure reason and the practical reason of Kant he has failed to bring out in its true light . He makes the practical reason depend upon the pure reason . This appears to us to be inverting the relation in which Kant left the two divisions of his subject . He showed the powerlessness of the pure reason to attain to certainty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and those which , like it , belong to the higher department of speculation . All the higher interests of the soul he would thus seem to have left undetermined . Here the practical reason comes to our aid . We have the moral law implanted in our being . We feel that , so far as our lives conform to this , they reach their true end ; so far as they depart from this , they become failures and wrecks . But reverence for the moral law , and the consciousness of its importance in the attainment of the true results of living , are not sufficient to insure obedience to it . We need some other help . Without this aid we feel our souls drifting away on the tides of worldliness and // sensuality . We must have the belief in a divine lawgiver , and in the immortality of the soul ; otherwise we can not maintain our allegiance . Thus do the inmost depths of our being demand a God , as he who is drifting and struggling and drowning amid the waves cries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a God , or that which is highest and holiest in us will perish . Speculative philosophy , if it does not affirm this , for the same reason can not deny it . We can not say that there is a God , but we can say that " there must be one " ; and " a must be is stronger than an is . " It is in regard to Hegel , however , that the peculiarities to which we have before alluded are most distinctly marked . Mr. Lewes does not profess to understand his philosophy ; that is , he continually speaks of it as if it were nonsense , which implies , of course , that it has no sense to him . It is easy to take the terms of any science , or detached portions of any scientific discussion , and make them appear ridiculous , or at least nonsensical , to one who has not the first principles of the science . What would be thought by such a one if he should hear , for instance , the account given in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a line which is continually approaching another line , which it yet could never meet , though it were prolonged to infinity ? If he should open a work upon the calculus , how much would he find that would seem to him absurd ! Such , for instance , would be the continual resolution of terms into infinity , which infinity he finds represented by a particular sign . Nay , even the simplest treatises on algebra would set his common sense at defiance . He would find , for in stance , that two minus quantities multiplied together make a plus quantity ; that is , multiply together two quantities each less than nothing and the result will be something . He would think that he had discovered the rule by *Thich the shopkeeper made his fortune , who told his customer " that he sold so cheap that he lost on every article . " " Then how do you support yourself ? " was the natural question ; which called forth the naive answer , " 0 , by selling so much as we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very starting-point . He would read a=X , and out would come his compasses , to show that there // was considerable difference between them . Now the incredulity and common-sense objections of the person whom we have supposed opening the mathematical book for the first time , are not one whit more absurd than the criticisms and half-compassionate contempt with which Mr. Lewes treats the logic of ilegel . Of this feeling such expressions as the following may be taken as examples - " Such pretensions would be laughable , were they not so painful to contemplate Of the three forms of Idealism , this surely is the most preposterous ; and that any sane man - not to speak of a man so eminent as Hegel - should for an instant believe in the correctness of the logic which brought him to this pass , ' that he should not at once reject the premises from which such conclusions followed , - must ever remain a wonder to all sober thinkers , - must ever remain a striking illustration of the unbounded confidence in bad logic which distinguishes metaphysicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pasta cbimnris , ' - truly a race mad with logic , and feeding the mind with chimeras This , it must be owned , looks like the insanity of Logic . " One would certainly think , that , before making such assertions as these , in regard to the writings of a man whose works impress one " with a sense of his wonderful power , " he would have given a careful study to the system , and have arrived as near as possible at its meaning . The very fact that Mr. Lewes professes to see nothing but nonsense in the works of Hegel , is , as has been said , a confession that he has not reached the sense of them . It would be very easy to show , by reference to particular passages , how far he has failed to attain to their true sense . It would be easy to show , in the same manner , how he contradicts himself in his assertions in regard to the system of which they treat . He calls one of them , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisting of " verbal quibbles . " In the next , he says that it " is a work requiring prodigious effort of thought to understand " ; and that , " if the student yields assent to the premises , he is sure to be dragged irresistibly to the conclusions . " But , instead of pursuing this style of criticism further , we will quote a paragraph from Mr. Lewes 's History , and will next show the basis upon which it is founded ; and // the reader may thus judge of the spirit with which he approaches this part of his work . The proposition to which reference is made in the first line is what Mr. Lewes translates , " Being and Non-Being are the same " ; but which we , considering the unphilosophical nature of our language , will translate , " Absolute and abstract being is nothing . " " Hegel admits the proposition to be somewhat paradoxical , " he writes , " and is fully aware of its openness to ridicule ; but he is not a man to be scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is aware that stupid common sense will ask , Whether it is the same if my house , my property , the air I breathe , this town , sun , the law , mind , or God , exist or not . ' Certainly , a very pertinent question : how does he answer it ? In such examples , ' he says , particular ends - utility , for instance - are understood , and then it is asked , if it is indifferent to me whether these useful things exist or not ? But , in truth , Philosophy is precisely the doctrine which is to free man from innumerable finite aims and ends , and to make him so indifferent to them , that it is really all the same whether such things exist or not . ' Here we trace the Alexandrian influence ; except that Plotinus would never have had the audacity to say that Philosophy was to make us indifferent whether God existed or not ; and it must have been a slip of the pen which made Hegel include God in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else the rigor of his pitiless logic , ' of which his disciples talk . Pitiless ' indeed ! - more intrepid absurdity it would be difficult to find . Remark , also , the evasive nature of his reply . Common sense suggests to him a plain , direct question , not without interest . This question , plain as it is , goes to the bottom of his system . He evades it by answering , that Philosophy has nothing to do with the interests of men . Very true ; his system has nothing to do with them . But the question put was not , Has Philosophy to concern itself with the interests of mankind ? ' The question put was , If , as you say , Being and Non-Being are the same , is it the same thing to have a house and not to have it ? ' Hegel might have given a better answer , even upon his own principles . " - pp. 728 , 729 . The reader will be somewhat surprised to find how entirely misrepresented are the words of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hegel does not say that in these examples particular ends , &amp;c. are understood . He says simply , " in some of them , " thus excluding the rest . His // expression is , Itt soichen Beispieler werden zum Theil , etc. * A few lines below , he introduces the serious and general reply to the objection , which Mr. Lewes demands , by the particles aber ilberhaupt , " but to speak generally . " We will not accuse Mr. Lewes of intentionally misrepresenting the words of the author whom he is considering ; we will not charge him with that ignorance of the German language , by which he failed to understand the meaning of the phrases which we have quoted . All that we say is , that he must have glanced hastily at the first part of the paragraph , and have left the last part of it unread . This is the care which he bestows upon the explanation of what he calls " the first proposition in Logic . " We think the reader will not be in doubt whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own blunders , best deserves the title of " frivolous . " Besides general misapprehensions , there is one other intimation that Mr. Lewes has never carefully read the work which he is holding up to contempt . In a note ( p. 723 ) he says : " This play upon words is assisted by the German auflieben , which means to suppress , ' as well as to preserve . ' See Ott , Hegel ella Philos . Allemande . " Had Mr. Lewes read Hegel 's own exposition of his doctrines , he would have found this double meaning of the word brought forward and insisted upon , as an example of the tendency of the German language to look upon all things from the stand-point of the reason ; and he would thus have needed no reference to outside authority . It can not certainly be required , that , in preparing a work like the History of Philosophy , a writer should necessarily consult the original writings of all the authors referred to . He may often use the labors of others , so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular study , and seem to have arrived at his true meaning . He may sometimes take their results as perhaps mbre to be relied upon than any at which he would be likely to arrive by independent research . Thus Schlegel can hardly be supposed to have read all the plays to which he refers in *7id . Hegel 's Enc. , Erster Theil , Die Logilc , ( Berlin , 1840 , ) p. 172. 22* // his work upon Dramatic Literature . Thus the naturalist i. forced to rely in part upon the observations of others . Without such permission as this , no general survey of any department of thought could be possible ; and certainly none of all departments . In regard to the early Grecian philosophy , there is no other method of reaching the facts . But when a man undertakes to ridicule a work , and to affirm that it is simply nonsense , we have a right to demand that he have some first-hand acquaintance with it ; or else that he state distinctly that he has no such acquaintance . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , namely , that his views are drawn from the original works of which he . speaks . In what has been said we do not wish to be understood as affirming that Mr. Lewes 's work is entirely unworthy of confidence or respect . In questions relating merely to English metaphysics , he shows considerable subtilty as a reasoner ; he has collected much that is interesting in regard to the Greek philosophers ; his biographies in general are well written , and the value of the work is increased by a copious index . It has been our purpose simply to show that , in regard to the later German systems of philosophy , and all questions growing out of these , he can not he regarded as of authority .
