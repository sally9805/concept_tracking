THOMAS CARLYLE . THOMAS CARLYLE is a name which no man of this generation should pronounce without respect ; for it belongs to one of the high-priests of modern literature , to whom all contemporary minds are indebted , and by whose intellect and influence a new spiritual cultus has been established in the realm of letters . It is yet impossible to estimate either the present value or the remote issues of the work which he has accomplished . We see that a revolution in all the departments of thought , feeling , and literary enterprise has been silently achieved amongst us , but we are yet ignorant of its full bearing , and of the final goal to which it is hurrying us . One thing , however , is clear respecting it : that it was not forced in the hot-bed of any possible fanaticism , but that it grew fairly out of the soil , a genuine product of the time and its circumstances . It was , indeed , a new manifestation of the hidden forces and vitalities of what we call Protestantism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to be heard once more in a world which seemed to ignore its existence , and had set up a ghastly skeleton of dry bones for its oracle and God . It was that necessary return to health , earnestness , and virtuous endeavor which Kreeshna speaks of in the Hindoo Geeta : " Whenever vice and corruption have sapped the foundations of the world , and men have lost their sense of good and evil , I , Kreeshna , make myself manifest for the restoration of order , and the establishment of justice , virtue , and piety . " And so this literary revolution , of which we are speaking , brought us from frivolity to earnestness , from unbelief and all the dire negations which it engenders , to a sublime faith in human duty and the providence of God . We have no room here to trace either the foreign or the native influences which , operating as antagonism or as inspiration upon the minds of Coleridge , Carlyle , and others , produced finally these great and memorable results . It is but justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new era . His fine metaphysical intellect and grand imagination , nurtured and matured in the German schools of philosophy and theology , reproduced the speculations of their great thinkers in a form and coloring which could not fail to be attractive to all seeking and sincere minds in England . The French Revolution and the Encyclopedists had already prepared the ground for the reception of new thought and revelation . Hence Coleridge , as writer and speaker , drew towards his centre all the young and ardent men of his time ,  --  and among others , the subject of the present article . Carlyle , however , does not seem to have profited much by the spoken discourses of the master ; and in his " Life of Sterling " he gives an exceedingly graphic , cynical , and amusing account of the oracular meetings at Highgate , where the philosopher sat in his great easy-chair , surrounded by his disciples and devotees , uttering , amid floods of unintelligible , mystic eloquence , those radiant thoughts and startling truths which warrant his claim to genius , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this early period of Carlyle 's life , when all the talent and learning of England bowed at timse levees before the gigantic speculator and dreamer , he , perhaps alone , stood aloof from the motley throng of worshippers ,  --  with them , but not of them ,  --  coolly analyzing every sentence delivered by the oracle , and sufficiently learned in the divine lore to separate the gold from the dross . What was good and productive he was ready to recognize and assimilate ; leaving the opium pomps and splendors of the discourse , and all the Oriental imagery with which the speaker decorated his // bathos , to those who could find profit therein . It is still more curious and sorrowful to see this great Coleridge , endowed with such high gifts , of so various learning , and possessing so marvellous and plastic a power over all the forms of language , forsaking the true for the false inspiration , and relying upon a vile drug to stimulate his large and lazy intellect into action . Carlyle seems to have regarded him at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ad although he sneers , with an almost Mephistophelean distortion of visage , at the philosopher 's half inarticulate drawling of speech , at his snuffy , nasal utterance of the everrecurrino " omnject " and " surnuject , " yet gleams of sympathy and affection , not unmixed with sorrow , appear here and there in what he says concerning him . And indeed , although the ilmacuse fame of Coleridge is scarcely warranted by his printed performances , he was , neverthe less , worthy both of affection and homage . For whilst we pity the weakness and disease of his moral nature , under the influence of that dark and terribly enchanting weed , we can not forget either his personal amiabilities or the great service which he rendered to letters and to society . Carlyle himself would be the last nian to deny this laurel to the brows of " the poet , the philosopher , and the divine , " as Charles Lamb calls him ; and it is certain that the thinking of Coleridge helped to fashion Carlyle 's mind , and not unlikely that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he had hitherto given to them . Coleridge had already formed a school both of divinity and philosophy . He had his disciples , as well as those faroff gazers who looked upon him with amazement and trembling , not knowing what to make of the phenomenon , or whether to regard him as friend or foe to the old dispensation and the established order of things . He had written books and poems , preached Unitarian sermons , recanted , and preached philosophy and Church-of-Englandism . To the dazzled eyes of all ordinary mortals , content to chew the cud of parish sermons , and swallow , Sunday after Sunday , the articles of common belief , he seemed an eccentric comet . But a better astronomy recognized him as a fixed star , for he was unmistakable by that fitting Few whose verdict is both history and immortality . But a greater than Coleridge , destined to assume a more commanding position , and exercise a still wider power over the minds of his age , arose in Thomas Carlyle . The son of a Scotch farmer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , and many severe struggles to win the education which is the groundwork of his greatness . His father was a man of keen penetration , who saw into the heart of things , and possessed such strong intellect and sterling common sense that the country people said " he always hit the nail on the head and clinched it . " His mother was a good , pious woman , who loved the Bible , and Luther 's " Table Talk , " and Luther , - walking humbly and sincerely before God , her Heavenly Father . Carlyle was brought up in the religion of his fathers and his country ; and it is easy to see in his writings how deep a root this solemn and earnest belief had struck down into his mind and character . He readily confesses how much he owes to his mother 's early teaching , to her beautiful and beneficent example of goodness and holiness ; and he ever speaks of her with affection and reverence . We once saw him at a friend 's house take up a folio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turn over the pages with a gentle and loving hand , reading here and there his mother 's favorite passages , - now speaking of the great historic value of the book , and again of its more private value , as his mother 's constant companion and solace . It was touching to see this pitiless intellect , which had bruised and broken the idols of so many faiths , to which Luther himself was recommended only by his bravery and self-reliance and the grandeur of his ' aims ,  --  it was touching , we say , and suggestive also of many // things , to behold the strong , stern man paying homage to language whose spirit was dead to him , out of pure love for his dear mother , and veneration also for the great heart in which that spirit was once alive that fought so grand and terrible a battle . Carlyle likes to talk of Luther , and , as his " Hero-Worship " shows , loves his character . A great , fiery , angry gladiator , with something of the bully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Luther to Erasmus , to Milton , to Carlyle himself ?  --  a dread image-breaker , implacable as Cromwell , but higher and nobler than he , with the tenderness of a woman in his inmost heart , full of music , and glory , and spirituality , and power ; his speech genuine and idiomatic , not battles only , but conquests ; and all his highest , best , and gentlest thoughts robed in the divine garments of religion and poetry ; - such was Luther , and as such Carlyle delights to behold him . Are they not akin ? We assuredly think so . For the blood of this aristocracy refuses to mix with that of churls and bastards , and flows pure and uncontaminated from century to century , descending in all its richness and vigor from Piromis to Piromis . The ancient philosopher knew this secret well enough when he said a Parthian and a Libyan might be related , although they had no common parental blood ; and that a man is not necessarily my brother because he is born of the same womb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those strong moral characteristics which are the attributes of all his heroes . An indomitable courage and persistency meet us everywhere in his pages ,  --  persistency , and also careful painstaking , and patience in sifting facts and gathering results . He disciplined himself to this end in early youth , and never allowed any study or work to conquer him . Speaking to us once in private upon the necessity of persevering effort in order to any kind of success in life , he said , " When I was a student , I resolved to make myself master of Newton 's Principia , ' and although I had not at that time knowledge enough of mathematics to make the task other than a Hercules-labor to me , yet I read and wrought unceasingly , through all obstructions and difficulties , until I had accomplished it ; and no Tamerlane conqueror ever felt half so happy as I did when the terrible book lay subdued and vanquished before me . " This trifling anecdote is a key to Carlyle 's character . To achieve his object , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his work , but does it faithfully and sincerely , with a man 's heart and hand . This outward sincerity in the conduct of his executive faculty has its counterpart in the inmost recesses of his nature . We feel that this man and falsehood are impossible companions , and our faith in his integrity is perfect and absolute . Herein lies his power ; and here also lies the power of all men who have ever moved the world . For it is in the nature of truth to conserve itself , whilst falsehood is centrifugal , and flies off into inanity and nothingness . It is by the cardinal virtue of sincerity alone-the truthfulness of deed to thought , of effect to cause-that man and nature are sustained . God is truth ; and he who is most faithful to truth is not only likest to God , but is made a participator in the divine nature . For without truth there is neither power , vitality , nor permanence . Carlyle was fortunate that he was comparatively poor , and never tempted , therefore , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay pursuits of university life . Not that there would have been any likelihood of his running into the excesses of ordinary students , but we are pleased and thankful to reflect that he suffered no kind of loss or harm in those days of his novitiate . It is one of the many consolations of poverty that it protects young men from snares and vices to which the rich are exposed ; and our poor student in his garret was preserved faithful to his vocation , and laid up day by day those stores of knowledge , 9 // experience , and heavenly wisdom which he has since turned to so good account . It would be deeply interesting , if we could learn the exact position of Carlyle 's mind at this time , with respect to those profound problems of human nature and destiny which have occupied the greatest men in all ages , ceaselessly and pertinaciously urging their dark and solemn questions , and refusing to depart until their riddles were in some sort solved . That Carlyle was hauntpd by these questions , and by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death ,  --  that he had to meet her face to face , staring at him with her stony , passionless eyes ,  --  that he had to grapple and struggle with her for victory , - there are proofs abundant in his writings . The details of the struggle , however , are not given us ; it is the result only that we know . But it is evident that the progress of his mind from the bogregion of orthodoxy to the high realms of thought and faith was a slow proceeding ,  --  not rolled onward as with the chariot-wheels of a fierce and sudden revolution , but gradually developed in a long series of births , growths , and deaths . The theological phraseology sticks to him , indeed , even to the present time , although he puts it to new uses ; and it acquires in his hands a power and significance which it possessed only when , of old , it was representative of the divine . Carlyle was matured in solitude . Emerson found him , in the year 1833 , on the occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a farm in iNithsdale , far away from all civilization , and " no one to talk to but the minister of the parish . " He , good man , could make but little of his solitary friend , and must many a time have been startled out of his canonicals by the strange , alien speeches which he heard . It is a pity that this minister had not had some of the Boswell faculty in him , that he might have reported what we should all be so glad to hear . Over that period of his life , however , the curtain fulls at present , to be lifted only , if ever , by Carlyle himself . Through the want of companionship , he fell back naturally upon books and his own thoughts . Here he wrote some of his finest critical essays for the reviews , and that " rag of a book , " as he calls it , the " Life of Schiller . " The essays show a catholic , hut conservative spirit , and are full of deep thought They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of analysis which is almost unique in letters . They are pervaded likewise by an earnestness and solemnity which are perfectly Hebraic ; and each performance is presented in a style decorated with all the costly jewels of imagination and fancy ,  --  a style of far purer and more genuine English than any of his subsequent writings , which are often marred , indeed , by gross exaggerations , and still grosser violations of good taste and the chastities of language . What made these writings , however , so notable at the time , and so memorable since , was that sincerity and deep religious feeling of the writer which we have already alluded to . Here were new elements introduced into the current literature , destined to revivify it , and to propagate themselves , as by seminal vitality , in myriad minds and forms . These utterances were both prophetic and creative , and took all sincere minds captive . Dry and arid in comparison as Egyptian deserts , lay all arQund him the writings of his contemporaries . No living waters flowed through them ; all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast was immense : a living soul and a dead corpse Since the era of the Commonwealth , - the holy , learned , intellectual , and earnest age of Taylor , Barrow , Milton , Fuller , - no such pen of fire had wrought its miracles amongst us . Writers spoke from the intellect , believed in the intellect , and divorced it from the soul and the moral nature . Science , history , ethics , religion , whenever treated of in literary form , were mechanized , and shone not with any spiritual illumination . There was abundaftee of lawyer-like ability ,  --  but of genius , and its accompanying // divine affiatus , little . Carlyle is full of genius ; and this is evidenced not only by the fine aroma of his language , but by the depths of his insight , his wondrous historical pictures ,  --  living cartoons of persons , events , and epochs , which he paints often in single sentences ,  --  and the rich mosaic of truths with which every of his writings is inlaid . page That German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less acquainted for ten years , had done much to foster and develope his genius there can be no doubt ; although the book which first created a storm in his mind , and awoke him to the consciousness of his own abundant faculty , was the " Confessions " of Rousseau ,  --  a fact which is well worthy of record and remembrance . He speaks subsequently of poor Jean Jacques with much sympathy and sorrow ; not as the greatest man of his time and country , but as the sincerest ,  --  a smitten , struggling spirit ,  --  " An infant crying in the night , An infant crying for the light , And with no language but a cry . " From Rousseau , and his strange thoughts , and wild , ardent eloquence , the transition to German literature was easy . Some one had told Carlyle that he would find in this literature what he had so long songht after ,  --  truth and rest ,  --  and he gladly learned the language , and addressed himself to the study of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he has grafted their thoughts upon his own , and whoever now speaks is more or less consciously impregnated by his influence . Who the man was that sent Carlyle to them does not appear , and so far as he is concerned it is of little moment to inquire ; but the fact constitutes the grand epoch in Carlyle 's life , and his true history dates from that period . It was natural that he should be deeply moved on his introduction to German literature . He went to it with an open and receptive nature , and with an earnestness of purpose which could not fail to be productive . Jean Paul , the beautiful - the good man , and the wise teacher , with poetic stuff in him sufficient to have floated an argosy of modern writers ,  --  this great , imaginative Jean Paul was for a long time Carlyle 's idol , whom he reverently and affectionately studied . He has written a fine paper about him in his " Miscellanies , " and we trace his influence not only in Carlyle 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their utterance . He was , indeed , warped by him , at one period clear out of his orbit , and wrote as he inspired . The dazzling sunbursts of Richter 's imagination , however , - its gigantic procession of imagery , moving along in sublime and magnificent marches from earth to heaven , from heaven to earth ,  - -  the array , symbolism , and embodiment of his manifold ideas , ceased in the end to enslave , though they still captivated Carlyle 's mind ; and he turns from him to the thinkers who deal with God 's geometry , and penetrate into the abysses of being ,  --  to primordial Kant , and his behenioth brother , Fichte . Nor does liege1 , or Schelling , or Schlegel , or Novalis escape his pursuit , but he hunts them all down , and takes what is needful to him , out of them , as his trophy . Schiller is his king of singers , although he does not much admire his " Philosophical Letters , " or his " Zllsthetic Letters . " But his grandest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the homage he renders him is worthy of a better and a holier idol . Goethe 's " Autobiography , " in so far as it relates to his early days , is a bad book ; and Wordsworth might well say of the " Wilhelm Meister , " that " it was full of all manner of fornication , like the crossing of flies in the air . " Goethe , however , is not to be judged by any fragmentary estimate of him , but as an intellectual whole ; for he represented the intellect , and grasped with his selfish and cosmical mind all the provinces of thought , learning , art , science , and government , for purely intellectual purposes . This entrance into , and breaking up of , the minds of these distinguished persons // was , however , a fine discipline for Carlyle , who is fully aware of its value ; and whilst holding communion with these great men , who by their genius and insight seemed to apprehend the essential truth of things at a glance , it is not wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mere logic-ability of English writers , as he shows himself in the essays of that period . Logic , useful as it is , as a help to reasoning , is but the dead body of thought , as Novalis designates it , and has no place in the inspired regions where the prophets and the bards reside . Carlyle 's fame , however , had not reached its culminating point when Emerson visited him . The English are a slow , unimpressionable people , not given to hasty judgments , nor too much nor too sudden praise ; requiring first to take the true altitude of a man , to measure him by severe tests ; often grudging him his proper and natural advantages and talents , buffeting and abusing him in a merciless and sometimes an unreasoning and unreasonable manner , allowing him now and then , however , a sunbeam for his consolation , until at last they come to a settled understanding of him , and he is generously praised and abused into the sanctuary of their worthies . This was not the case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had the highest recognitions from some of those who constitute the flower and chivalry of England , he was far better known and more widely read in America than in his own country . Emerson , then a young man , with a great destiny before him , was attracted by his writings , and carried a letter of introduction to him at Craigenputtock . " He was tall and gaunt , with a cliff-like brow ; self-possessed , and holding his extraordinary powers of conversation in easy command ; clinging to his northern accent with evident relish ; full of lively anecdote , and with a streaming humor which floated everything he looked upon . " He is the same man , in his best moods , in the year 1857 , as he was in 1833 . His person , except that he stoops slightly , is tali , and very little changed . He is thinner , and the once ruddy hues of his cheek are dying away like faint streaks of light in the twilight sky of a summer evening . But he is strong and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing keeps him in a perpetual fever , deranges his liver , and makes him at times acrid and savage as a sick giant . Hence his increased pugnacity of late ,  --  his fierceness , and angry hammering of all things sacred and profane . It is but physical and temporary , however , all this , and does not affect his healthy and serene moments . For no man lives who possesses greater kindness and affection , or more good , noble , and humane qualities . All who know him love him , although they may have much to pardon in him ; not in a social or moral sense , however , but in an intellectual one . His talk is as rich as ever ,  --  perhaps richer ; for his mind has increased its stores , and the old fire of geniality still burns in his great and loving heart . Perhaps his conversation is better than his printed discourse . We have never heard anything like it . It is all alive , as if each word had a soul in it . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his " English Traits " ! a book , by the way , concerning which no adequate word has yet been spoken ; the best book ever written upon England , and which no brave young Englishman can read , and ever after commit either a mean or a bad action . We are therefore doubly thankful to Emerson , both for what he says of England , and for what he relates of Carlyle , whose independent speech upon all subjects is one of his chief charms . He reads " Blackwood , " for example , and has enjoyed many a racy , vigorous article in its pages ; but it does not satisfy him , and he calls it " Sand Magazine . " " Fraser 's " is alittle better , but not good enough to be worthy of a higher nomenclature than " Mud Magazine . " Excessive praise of any one 's talents drives him into admiration // of the parts of his own learned pig , now wi*llowing in the stye . The best thing he knew about America was that there a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read Plato , and he disparaged Socrates . Mirabeau was a hero ; Gibbon the splendid bridge from the old world to the new . It is interesting also to bear that " Tristram Shandy " was one of the first books he read after " Robinson Crusoe , " and that Robertson 's " America " was an early favorite . Rousseau 's " Confessions " had discovered to him that he was not a dunce . Speaking of English pauperism , he said that government should direct poor men what to do . " Poor Irish folks come wandering over these moors . My dame makes it a rule to give to every son of Adam bread to eat , and supplies his wants to the next house . But here are thousands of acres which might give them all meat , and nobody to bid those poor Irish go to the moor and till it . They burned the stacks , and so found a way to force the rich people to attend to them . " Here is the germ of his book on " Chartism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul , seated on the hill-tops near Old Criffel , and looking down " into Wordsworth 's country . " Carlyle had the natural disinclination of every nimble spirit to bruise itself against walls , and did not like to place himself where no step can be taken ; but he was honest and true , and cognizant of the subtile links that bind ages together , and saw how every event affects all the future . " Christ died on the tree ; that bhilt Dunscore Kirk yonder ; that brought you and me together . Time has only a relative existence . " Such is Enierson 's account of his first visit to our author , whose eyes were already turned towards London as the heart of the world , whither he subsequently went , and where he now abides . From Craigenputtock , with its savage rocks and moorlands , its sheepwalk solitudes , its isolation and distance from all the advantages of civil and intellectual life , to London and the living solitude of its unnumberable inhabitants , its activities , polity , and world-wide ramifications of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a change of great magnitude , whose true proportions it took time to estimate . Carlyle , however , was not afraid of the huge mechanism of London life , but took to it bravely and kindly , and was soon at home amidst the everlasting whirl and clamor , the roar and thunder of its revolutions . For although a scholar , and bred in seclusion , he was also a genuine man of the world , and well acquainted with its rough ways and Plutonic wisdom . This knowledge , combined with his strong " common sense , " - as poor Dr. Beattie calls it , fighting for its supremacy with canine ferocity ,  --  gave Carlyle high vantage-ground in his writings . He could meet the world with its own weapons , and was cunning enough at that fence , as the world was very shortly sensible . He was saved , therefore , from the contumely which vulgar minds are always ready to bestow upon saints and mystics who sit aloof from them , high enthroned amidst the truths and solemnities of God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable as it undoubtedly is to contemplation and internal development , has likewise its disadvantages , and puts them , as being undisciplined in the *ways of life , at great odds , when they come to the actual and practical battle . A man should be armed at all points , and not subject himseW like good George Fox , Jacob Bebmen , and other holy men , to the taunts of the mob , on account of any awkward gait , mannerism , or ignorance of men and affairs . Paul had none of these absurdities about him ; but was an accomplished person , as well as a divine speaker . His doctrine of being all things to all men , that he might win souls to Christ , is , like good manners and politeness , a part of that mundane philosophy which obtains in every society , both as theory and performance ; not , however , in its literal ' meaning , which would involve all sorts of hypocrisy and // lies as its accessories , but in the sense of ability to meet all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own enginery of warfare . Strength , whether of mind or body , is sure to command respect , even though it be used against ourselves ; for we AngloSaxons are all pugilists . A man , therefore , who accrcdits his metal by the work he accomplishes , will be readily enough heard when he comes to speak and labor upon higher platforms . This was the case with Carlyle ; and when he published that new Book of Job , that weird and marvellous Pilgrim 's Progress of a modern cultivated soul , the " Sartor Resartus , " in " Fraser 's Magazine , " strange , wild , and incomprehensible as it was to most men , they did not put it contemptuously aside , but pondered it , laughed at it , trembled over it and its dread apocalyptical visions and revelations , respecting its earnestness and eloquence , although not comprehending what manner of writing it essentially was . Carlyle enjoyed the perplexity of his readers and reviewers , neither of whom , with the exception of men like Sterling , and a writer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were talking about when they spoke of it . The criticisms upon it were exceedingly comical in many instances , and the author put the most notable of these together , and always alluded to them with roars of laughter . The book has never yet received justice at the bands of any literary tribunal . It requires , indeed , a large amount of culture to appreciate it , either as a work of art , or as a living flame-painting of spiritual struggle and revelation . In his previous writings he had insisted upon the sacredness and infinite value of the human soul ,  --  upon the wonder and mystery of life , and its dread surroundings ,  --  upon the divine significance of the universe , with its star pomp , and overhanging immensities ,  --  and upon the primal necessity for each man to stand with awe and reverence in this august and solemn presence , if he would hope to receive any glimpses of its meaning , or live a true and divine life in the world ; and in the " Sartor " he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hero . He saw that religion had become secular ; that it was reduced to a mere Sunday holiday and Vanity Fair , taking no vital hold of the lives of men , and radiating , therefore , none of its blessed and beautiful influences about their feet and ways ; that human life itself , with all its adornments of beauty and poetry , was in danger of paralysis and death ; that love and faith , truth , duty , and holiness , were fast losing their divine attributes in the common estimation , and were hurrying downwards with tears and a sad threnody into gloom and darkness . Carlyle saw all this , and knew that it was the reaction of that intellectual idolatry which brought the eighteenth century to a close ; knew also that there was only one remedy which could restore men to life and health ,  --  namely , the quickening once again of their spiritual nature . He felt , also , that it was his mission to attempt* this miracle ; and hence the prophetic fire and vehemence of his words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can read him without feeling himself arrested as hy the grip of a giant ,  --  without trembling before his stern questions , inculcations , and admonitions . There is a God , o Man ! and not a blind chance , as governor of this world . Thy soul has infinite relations with this God , which thou canst never realize in thy being , or manifest . in thy practical life , save by a devout reverence for him , and his miraculous , awful universe . This reverence , this deep , abiding religious feeling , is the only link which binds us to the Infinite . That severed , broken , or destroyed , and man is an alien and an orphan ; lost to him forever is the key to all spiritual mystery , to the hieroglyph of the soul , to the symbolism of nature , of time , and of eternity. - Such , as we understand it , is Carlyle 's teaching . But this is not ali . Man is to he man in that high sense we have spoken // of ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folding his robes of immortality around him , as if God had done with him for all practical purposes , and he with God , - but for action , - action in a world which is to prove his power , his beneficence , his usefulness . That spiritual fashioning by the Great Fashioner of all things is so ordained that we ourselves may become fashioners , workers , makers . For it is given to no man to be an idle cumberer of the ground , but to dig , and sow , and plant , and reap the fruits of his labor for the garner . This is man 's first duty , and the diviner he is the more divinely will he execute it . That such a gospel as this could find utterance in the pages of the " Edinburgh Review " is curious enough ; and it is scarcely less surprising that the " Sartor Resartus " should make its first appearance in the somewhat narrow and conservative pages of Fraser . Carlyle has clearly written his own struggles in this book ,  --  his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " - that dreadful realm of enchantment , where all the forms of nature are frozen forever in dumb imprisonment and despair ,  --  the great vaulted firmament no longer serene and holy and loving as God 's curtain for his children 's slumbers , but flaming in starry portents , and dropping down over the earth like a funeral pall ; through this region of lifesemblance and death-reality the lonely and aching pilgrim wanders ,  --  questionIng without reply ,  --  wailing , broken , selfconsuming ,  --  looking with eager eyes for the waters of immortality , and finding nothing but pools of salt and Marahs of bitterness . Herein is no Calvary , no Cross-symbolism , by whose miraculous power he is relieved of his infinite burden of sorrow , starting onward with hope and joy in his heart ; nor does he ever find his Calvary until the deeps of his spiritual nature are broken up and flooded with celestial light , as he knocks reverently at the portals of heaven for communion with his Father who is in heaven . Then bursts upon him a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is but a fable of divine truth , hiding its secrets from all but the initiated and the worthy , and that faith , and trust , and worship are the cipher which unlocks them all . He thus arrives at the plains of heaven in the region of the " Everlasting Yes . " His own sod lies naked and resolved before him ,  --  its unspeakable greatness , its meaning , faculty , and destiny . Work , and dutiful obedience to the laws of work , are the outlets of his power ; and herein he finds peace and rest to his soul . That Carlyle is not only an earnest , but a profoundly religious man , the attempted elucidations of his teachings will abundantly show . his religion , however , is very far remote fro* i*hat is called religion in this day . He has no patience with second-hand beliefs ,  --  with articles of faith ready-made for the having . Whatsoever is accepted by men because it is the tradition of their fathers , and not a deep conviction arrived at by legitimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all merely historical and intellectual faith , standing outside the man , and not absorbed in the life as a vital , moving , and spiritual power , he places also amongst the chaff for burning . This world is a serious world , and human life and business are also serious matters ,  --  not to be trifled with , nor cheated by shams and hypocrisies , but to be deelt with in all truth , soberness , and sincerity . No one can thus deal with it who is not himself possessed of these qualities , and the result of a life is the test of what virtue there is in it . False men leave no mark . It is truth nlone which does the masonry of the world ,  --  which founds empires , and builds cities , and establishes laws , commerce , and civilization . And in private life the same law abides , indestructible as God . Carlyle 's teaching tends altogether in this direction ; and whilst he belongs to no church and no creed , he is tolerant of all , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fellows , 1857.1 193 // He is no Catholic ; and yet for years he read little else than the forty volumes of the " Acta Sanctorum , " and found , he says , all Christian history there , and much of profane history . Neither is he a Mahometan ; but he nevertheless makes a hero of Mahomet , whom he loves for his Ishmaclite fierceness , bravery , and religious sincerity ,  --  and because he taught deism , or the belief in one God , instead of the old polytheism , or the belief in many gods ,  --  and gave half the East his very good book , called the Koran , for his followers to live and die by . Whether this large catholicism , this worship of heroes , is the best*of what now remains of religion on earth is certainly questionable enough ; and if we regard it in no other light than merely as an idolatry of persons , there is an easy answer ready for it . But considering that religion is now so far dead that it consists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no longer such to half the great world , which lies , indeed , in dire atrophy and wickedness ,  --  and if we further consider aftd agree that the awakened human soul is the divinest thing on earth , and partakes of the divine nature itself , and that its manifestations are also divine in whomsoever it is embodied , we can see some apology for its adoption ; inasmuch as it is the divine likeness to which reverence and homage are rendered , and not the person merely , but only so far as he is the medium of its showing . Christianity , however , will assuredly survive , although doubtless in a new form , preserving all the integrity of its i*essage ,  --  and be once more faith and life to men , when the present old , established , decaying cultus shall be venerated only as history . Carlyle clings to the Christian formulary-and the old Christian life in spite of himself . He is almost fanatical in his attachment to the medieval times ,  --  to the ancient worship , its ceremonial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saints and martyrs . And the reason , as he shows in the " Past and Present , " is , that all this array of devotion , this pomp and ceremony , this music and painting , this gorgeous and sublime architecture , this fasting and praying , were real ,  --  faithful manifestations of a religion which to that people was truly genuine and holy . They who built the cathedrals of Europe , adorned them with carvings , pictures , and those stately windows with their storied illuminations which at this day are of n miracles of beauty and of art , were not frivolous modern conventicle-builders , but poets as grand as Milton , and sculptors whose genius might front that of Michel An* , elo . It was no dead belief in a dead religion which designed and executed these matchless temples . Man and Religion were both alive in those days ; and the worship of God was so *r6found a prostration of the inmost spirit before his majesty and glory , that the souls of the artists seem to have been inspired , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temples it is neither in the devotion nor the faculty of the modern Western world to conceive or construct . Carlyle knows all this , and he falls back in loving admiration upon those old times and their worthies , despising the filigree materials of which the men of to-day are for the most part eomposed . He revels in that picture of monastic life , also , which is preserved in the record of Jocelyn de Brakebade . He sees all men at work there , each at his proper vocation ; and he praises them , because they fear God and do their duty . He finds them the same men , although with better and devonter hearts , as we are at this day . Time makes no difference in this verdant human nature , which shows ever the same in Catholic monasteries as in Puritan meeting-houses . We have a wise preachment , however , from that Past , to the Present , in Carlyle 's book , which is one of his best efforts , and contains isolated passages which for wisdom and beauty , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no space to speak here of all his books with anything like critical // integrity . The greatest amongst them , however , is , perhaps , his " French Revolution , a llistory , " - which is no history , hut a vivid painting of characters and events as they moved along in tumultuous procession . No one can appreciate this book who is not acquainted with the history in its details beforehand . Emerson once related to us a striking anecdote connected with this work , which gives us another glimpse of Carlyle 's character . He had just completed , after infinite labor , one of the three volumes of his history , which he left exposed on his study table when he went to bed . Next morning he sought in vain for the manuscript , and had welinigh concluded with Robert Hall , who was once in a similar dilemma , that the Devil had run away with it , when the servant-girl , on being questioned , confessed that she had burnt it to kindle the fire . Carlyle neither stamped nor raved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In summing up the present results of Carlyle 's labor , foolish men of the world and small critics have not failed to ask what it all amounts to ,  --  what the great Demiurgus is aimingat in his weary hattle of life ; and the question is significant enough ,  --  one more proof of that Egyptian darkness of vision which he is here to dispel . " He pulls down the old , " say they ; " but what does he give us in place of it ? Why does he not strike out a system of his own ? And after all , there is nothing new in him . " Such is the idle talk of the day , and such are the men who either guide the people , or seek to guide them . Poor ignorant souls ! who do not know the beginning of the knowledge which Carlyle teaches , nor its infinite importance to life and all its concerns - this , namely , as we have said before , that the soul should first of all be wakened to the consciousness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the miracles of the universe. , and rise hy aspiration and faith to the knowledge and worship of God , in whom are all things ; that this attitude of the soul , and its accompanying wisdom , will beget the strength , purity , virtue , and truth which can alone restore order and beauty upon the earth ; that all " systems , " and mechanical , outward means and appliances to the end , will but increase the Babel of confusion , as things unfitted to it , and altogether extraneous and hopeless . Systems ! " It is living , truthful men we want ; these will make their own systems ; and let those who doubt the truth humbly watch and wait until it is manifest to them , or go on their own arid and sorrowful ways in what peace they can find there . The catholic spirit of Carlyle 's works can not be better illustrated than by the fact that he has received letters from all sorts and conditions of men , Methodists and Shakers , Churchmen and Romanists , Deists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find their peculiarities of thought in him . This is owing partly , perhaps , to the fact that in his earlier writings he masked his sentiments both in Hebraic and Christian phraseology ; and partly . to the lack of vision in his admirers , who could not distinguish a new thought in an old garment . his " Cromwell " deceived not a few in this respect ; and we were once asked in earnest , by a man who should have been better informed , if Carlyle was a Puritan . Whatever he may be called , or believed to be , one thing is certain concerning him : that he is a true and valiant man ,  --  all out a man !  --  and that literature and the world are deeply indebted to him . His mission , like that of Jeremy Collier in a still baser age , was to purge our literature of its falsehood , to recreate it , and to make men once more believe in the divine , and live in it . So earnest a man has not am peared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts are so suggestive , germinal , and propagative . All our later writers* are tinged with his thought , and he has to answer for such men as Kingsley , Newman , Froude , and others who will not answer for him , nor acknowledge hint Kin private life Carlyle is amiable , and often high and beautiful in his demeanor. // He talks much , and , as we have said , well ; impatient , at times , of interruption , and at other times readily listening to those who have anything to say . But he hates babblers , and cant , and sham , and has no mercy for them , but sweeps them away in the whirlwind and terror of his wrath . He receives distinguished men , in the evening , at his house in Chelsea ; but he rarely visits . He used occasionally to grace the saloons of Lady Blessington , in the palmy days of her life , when she attracted around her all noble and be utiful persons , who were distin guished by their attainments in literature , science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now for such a purpose . He is at present engaged in his " Life of Frederick the Great , " whom he will hardly make a hero of , and with whom , we learn , lie is already very heartily disgusted . The first volume will shortly appear . And now we must close this imperfect paper-reserving for a future occasion some personal reminiscences of him , which may prove both interesting and illustrative .
