// qwq whose very tails decorated the chimney-glass , had not Keziah , the maid , reminded her that the young lady was the donor . Then she recollected her henefactor , and asked after her father , the Baronet ; and wondered , for her part , why her boy , the Colonel , was not made baronet , and why his brother had the property ? Her father was a very good man ; though Mrs. Mason had heard he was not much liked in those parts . " Dead and gone , was he , poor man ? " ( This came in reply to a hint from Keziah , the attendant , bawled in the old lady 's ears , who was very deaf . ) " Well , well , we must all go ; and if we were all good , like the Colonel , what was the use of staying ? I hope his wife will be good . I am sure such a good man deserves one , " added Mrs. Mason . The ladies thought the old woman doting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maid , that Mrs. Mason have a lost her memory . And she asked who the other bonny lady was , and Ethel told her that Mrs. Pendennis was a friend of the Colonel 's and Clive 's . " Oh , Clive 's friend ! Well , she was a pretty lady , and he was a dear pretty boy . He drew those pictures ; and he took off me in my cap , with my old cat and all-my poor old cat that 's buried this ever so long ago . " " She has had a letter from the Colonel , Miss , " cries out Keziab . " Have n't you had a letter from the Colonel , mum ? It came only yesterday . " And Keziah takes out the letter and shows it to the ladies . They read as follows : " London , February 12 , 184- . " My DEAR OLD MAsON-I have just heard from a friend of mine who has been staying in your neighborhood , that you are well and happy , and that you have been making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is well and happy too . " The letter which was uritten to me about you was sent to me in Belgium , at Brussels , where I have been living  --  a town near the place where the famous Battle of Waterloo was fought ; and as I had run away from Waterloo , it *follamed me to England . " I can not come- to Newcome just now to shake my dear old friend and nurse by the hand . I have business in London ; and there are those of my name living in Newcome who would not be very happy to sue me and mine . " But I promise you a visit before very long , and Clive will come with me ; and when we come I shall introduce a new friend to you , a very pretty little duughter-ia-law , whom you must promise to love very much . She is a Scotch lassie , niece of my oldest friend , James Binnie , Esquire , of the Bengal Civil Service , who will give her a pretty bit of sillar , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that there was something between Clive and my wife , for when Laura had read the letter she laid it down on the table , and sitting down by it , and , hiding her face in her hands , burst into tears . Ethel looked steadily at the two pictures of Clive and his father . Then she put her hand on her friend 's shoulder . " Come , my dear , " she said , " it is growinglate , and I must go back to my children . " And she saluted Mrs. Mason and her maid in a very stately manner , and left them , leading my wife away , who was still exceedingly overcome . We could not stay long at Rosebury after that . When Madame do Moncontour heard the news , the good lady cried too . Mrs. Pendennis 's emotion was renewed as we passed the gates of Newcome Park on our way to the railroad . THE SISTERS : A PARSON 'S STORY . A NARRATIVE OF FACTS . Q HE was gasping when I came in . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be -- fore we were prepared for the terrible event , we knew that death was at the door . The house in which Mrs. Bell had lived for twenty years , and was now dying , was an oldfashioned mansion on the hill overlooking the village and the bay , and a wide expanse of meadow fhat stretched away to the water 's edge . On the side toward the sea was a long piazza , a favorite resort of the family in summer , when the weather was pleasant . I was walking on it , and now and then looking off upon the world below , but with my thoughts more turned upon the scenes that were passing within . I had been sent for , a few hours before , and to my consternation and grief had found Mrs. Bell already given up by her physicians , and her life rapidly rushing to its close . her disease was inflammatory . Its progress had defied all human skill , and two days had brought her to this ! It was hard to believe it . But why should I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering anguish which even my sympathies could not reach to relieve ? Exhausted with my vain but earnest efforts to soothe the heart-rending grief of those who clung to the dying , I had loft the chamber . Mrs. Bell was a member of my church . Mr. Bell was not . lie was reputed to be a man of means , and was known to be living easily , doing but little business , and apparently caring for nothing in the future . No one suspected that this indifference had resulted in the gradual wastin0 away of the property he had inherited ; // mortgages covering all the landed estates he was known to possess , till even the homestead was in danger . But the pride of my parish was in this family . Two daughters , with only the difference of a year in their ages , and now just coming up into womanhood , were the only children of Mr. and Mrs. Bell . Sarah was the oldest , and her blue eyes and yellow hair were like her mother 's , and the younger , Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and locks of the raven hue . They were sisters in heart , soul , and mind , though a stranger would not have taken them to be the children of the same mother . Such love as hound them was wonderful to me , who , as the pastor of the family , was often there , and knew them well . I had watched its growth for ten years , and frequently had remarked that it exceeded in tenderness and devotion any thing of the kind that had ever fallen under my notice . Mrs. Bell had a thousand-fold more opportunities of putting it to the test , and of seeing it tried in the daily and hourly intercourse of the family , and she had told me that she had never known a moment of failure in the season of childhood and of youth , when the temper is often tried , and children are called on to make sacrifices for one another in little things , far greater tests of love than the struggles of after-life . She had observed , and had mentioned to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . Their minds were turned at one and the same moment toward the same subject , when there appeared to be nothing suggestive of the train of thought engaging them both . A secret thread seemed to connect their souls , so that what was passing in one 's mind was often at work in the other 's . Instead of provoking dissension , as such a coincidence would naturally produce , it was rather a bond of union , leading them to love the same pleasures , and to study and labor to promote each other 's joys . This was the more remarkable as their natural temperaments were unlike . The eldest was sanguine and cheerful , a sunbeam always shining in the house , glad and making glad  --  the brightest , happiest , gleefulest girl in my parish . Mary was sedate . Like her father , she was not inclined to action . Even in her childhood a tinge of melancholy gave a coloring to her life . She was fond of reading and retirement . When alone , her thoughts were her own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her faithful as a sister and a child ; but there was a trai.t of character in which her sister , with all their sympathy , did not share . It was requisite , this contrast , to make them two . There was individuality , notwithstanding the kin-tie of spirit binding them as one , in a deep , earnest , true-hearted love that knew no break or change . But I am dwelling on these features of the children while the mother is dying . I was walking up and down the piazza , thinking of the awful work death was making in this house ; of the wondrous love that bound mother and daughters , now to be no barrier in the way of this fell destroyer , half wishing I had the power to stay his arm , and drive him out of the paradise he was about to blast with his breath , when a servant summoned me to the chamber . She was gasping us I entered . The fever raging in her veins had suffused her cheeks with crimson : the rich hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was many , many years ago-she had worn in a mass sustained by a comb on the back of her head , now hung in great ringlets on her shoulders , and the eye , sparkling with the last light of life , was fixed on her daughters kneeling at the bedside , giving vent to their bitter grief in floods of tears , and sobs they strove in vain to suppress . Yet she knew me . She raised her hand as I came in , and said to me as I approached , " I know that my Redeemer liveth . " Before I could find words , she added : " My children  --  the poor girls-be kind to them-be a friend to my dear husband . " It was her last effort . While I had been out of the room she had taken leave of those dearest in life , and was now breathing away her spirit calmly , for she was not afraid to die , peacefully , for the pains of death were past . It was all over . The stricken daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , betraying less emotion than we thought he would show in the midst of such a scene , retired , and I was for a moment alone with the dead . Wondrous the change that an instant had wrought ! Out on an unknown sea the soul had drifted , and left this wreck upon the shore  --  a dissolving hulk  --  a heap of clay that would soon be loathsome to those who an hour ago were hanging over it with intensest love , covering it with kisses , and folding it in their arms . They call this awful work by the name of death ! But this is not the last of Mrs. Bell , the lovely , living Mrs. Bell . She is not dead . This is not the wife , the mother , the friend . She is not here . And as she is not here , we can do nothing more for her . A few days afterward we laid her in the grave . She was a great favorite among our people , and they were all present at her buriaL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it was kindness to let them weep freely , and have their own way in the first gush of their great sorrow . Perhaps time would do something for them . Religion would shed a soothing influence over their crushed and bleeding hearts , but now it was better to let the streams of affection flow along in these gushing tears , for there is a medicine in weeping that I the first remedy of grief . ir . Mr. Bell died in less than a year . He was seized with a fit of apoplexy , while sitting on the piazza after dinner , and died without a word . The daughters were not at home , but were sent for in all haste , and arrived just as I did , being called again to the house where so recently // I had seen the fairest and fondest of mothers expire . The body of Mr. Bell , dressed as he died , was lying on the same bed which I had last seen , when the corpse of his wife was there . It seemed but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same Bible lay on the same stand , near the bed , and I had heard that he read it oftener since the death of his wife . The same bureau with drawers and covered with a white cloth , a few choice books standing on it , was on the other side of the room , and a large easy-chair stuffed and clothed with dimity , and a few simple but very convenient articles completed the furniture of the apartment . But instead of the pale form of my gentle friend , Mrs. Bell , lovely even in death , there was lying on that white counterpane the large and now blackened corpse of her husband . The physician , who had been early on the ground , had found him dead . The case was a plain one . Indeed he had been often warned of such an event , but his habitual fondness of putting things off had led him to neglect all means of improving or preserving his health , and he had been cut down in the midst of his days . But the daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the friend on whom they might lean , and who would not forget the dying request of their sainted mother . They bad loved their father with all the earnestness of their nature , and all the more since the death of their mother had made him dependent on them for a thousand nameless acts and arts of kindness which he had ever received from his faithful wife . And the loneliness that now lay before them was so appalling that they feared to look into the future . They had no brother , no relative to whom they might turn . It was not strange that such thoughts pressed on them , even at the side of their dead father , and that in the midst of their anguish under this sudden and overwhelming blow , they should every now and then cry out , " What shall we do ? And who could answer the question ? If it was a sad and fearful inquiry while as yet we believed that Mr. Bell had left behind him a large and handsome property , it was more distressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was discovered that he was hopelessly involved in debt , and after the claims of his creditors were but partially satisfied , it would leave nothing , not a cent , not the homestead , not the house , not even the furniture to his daughters . He was a bankrupt , and had been for a long time past , but he had no energy to meet the calamity , and death came on him just as his affairs were reaching a crisis that put further concealment of the state of his affairs out of the question . Perhaps the coming disclosure hastened the blow that killed him . l3ut the facts could no longer be hid even from those whom they must crush . Poor girls ! In every sense that makes that word poor a term of pity , these girls were now poor indeed . Had it been possible for me in my circumstances to have assumed the burden , I would gladly have taken them to my own home , and made them sharers with my children in the weal or woe in store for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But something must be done , and that with no delay . The estate was administered upon in a few weeks , and as there were no funds to meet the debts , the law took its course , and the orphans were homeless . Their education had been domestic . Mrs. Bell had been their teacher . They were well read girls , but not fitted to teach others . So that door was not open to them . Sarah particularly , with a fine imagination and a decidedly poetical turn of mind , was familiar with the literature of her own language , which she was accustomed to read with her mother . Many of her letters are now in my possession , and they are clothed in language at once graceful and rich , and some of them are beautiful in style and thought . Mary had less taste for reading , yet she thought more and felt deeper than her sister . In the retirement of that home circle the mother and daughters , with an industry more common perhaps in those days than it is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was natural that the girls should turn to that in which they were the most expert , as the means on which they must rely for their main support , now that they were thrown upon their own resources , or upon the charity of the world . They had too much selfreliance and too much confidence in God , to trust themselves to the kindness of friends who , in the impulse of sudden sympathy , might offer to do for them what would soon prove to be a task and a burden . No ; they would meet the emergency with the energy of faith and hope , knowing that God helps those who help themselves . They gave themselves scant time for mourning . They left the home of their infancy and childhood  --  the third great sorrow of their lives . But now that father and mother were both gone , even the honeysuckle that climbed up the piazza , and the beds of flowers they had planted and tended with their own hands , and the fruit that hung in rich abundance in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them of days when in happy youth they had enjoyed them all with the parents they had lost , and it was almost a relief to turn their backs upon the home they had loved , and seek a humble lodging in the village . III . For they are sewing-girls now . It was nothing that they were young and pretty and wellbred . They must have food and raiment and shelter , and they could earn all by the labor of their hands . They were not the girls to shrink from the contest with pride and custom , and the thousand and one mortifications to which this new and trying life would lead . Sarah led and Mary followed . They had no words about it . Sarah proposed it , and Mary had been thinking of the same plan . It was the only one before them . And it was not so hopeless as it might be . They had many friends . They would find // work , plenty of it . and it would be sweeter to live on the bread of honest industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive it without asking . It was a noble resolution . They consulted me before coming to a decision , and I could not oppose their scheme , though I had no heart to counsel them to go on with it . The future would be so unlike the past . These sensitive natures-these children as they were to me , who had known them so long as children only  --  to be exposed to the rough-and-tumble of the life of orphans , was bad enough under almost any aspect of the case . But to be harassed by the daily vexatious , and wearied by the daily toils of the life of a seamstress , was more than I could think of without tears ; and I admired the fortitude with which they addressed themselves to the work they had assumed . Mrs. Benson was a friend indeed . She was of one of the most influential families in my flock , and had been the bosom friend of Mrs. Bell while she was yet with us . Mrs. Benson offered the girls a home , and when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her as to a mother in the future , whatever might be the issue of the new and untried experiment they were about to make . We shall , however , overrate the heroism of the girls if we measure it by the sacrifice of feeling which such a mode of life would require at the present time ; In our rural village of a thousand inhabitants , the girls would not be the less esteemed by any of the better sort of people for their new employment . On the contrary , the door of every house would be open to them , and every voice would be one of kindness to greet them when they came . " I shall die , I know I shall , " said Mary , as they were alone in the snug parlor of the old homestead for the last time . " I feel it here " - as she laid her hand on her side , and pressed her beating heart . " I can never leave it , and feel that it is to be no home of ours again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her more hopeful sister , " we could not be at home if we staid here . It is all gloomy now , and wbat there is to love will be as much ours hereafter as it ever was . These walks will be here , and these trees and flowers , and we will often come and look on them ; for whoever lives here will never deny us the privilege . And we are to do for ourselves now . It is too soon to be discouraged . God will help us , and that right early . " " Yes , Sister Sarah , I know all that , and more , but I am afraid . It is dreadful , this gain out into the world alone . It looks so dark . My head aches when I think of it . A great black cloud seems to he hanging over us ; and sometimes I think I am growing blind , every thing is so dark before me-tell me now , truly , have you had no such fears ? " " But I will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do come to me , as to you , and sometimes they frighten me , but I drive them away , and look to God for strength . Fearful thoughts never come from him . He is our father now , more than ever , and has promised that he will never leave nor forsake us . " Mary was silenced , but not satisfied . Sarah could thus reason her into resignation , but it was still very dark and trying ; and , to her de. * sponding nature , there was something in store for them more terrible than they had yet experienced . The presentiment was dim and might be idle , but it was deep-seated and absorbing . She said it was in her heart , but it was in her brain . She often pressed her hand hard on her forehead , and then thrust her head into Sarah 's bosom , not weeping , but asking her sister to hide her from the terrible fate that gathered about her , and threatened to blast them both in the morning of their grief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a question often on Sarah 's mind when coming to this decision that she must be a seamstress . George had never told her that he loved her , but he had been kind and attentive , and a thou sand nameless acts had given her the assurance that he was more to her than a friend . She was not insensible . Sarah would have loved him had he sought her love . Happily for her own peace , he had made no advances , and when he learned that she and her sister were not only orphans but poor , he discovered that he had no particular regard for either of them , and with no words , left them to their fate . Perhaps this blow to Sarah 's hopes , for she had hopes , was necessary to complete the misery of her portion . A noble , faithful friend to stand by her in such an hour , would have been like life to the dead . There was no such stay for her now . And the two sisters , finding that few friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and trusting only in God , to do what they could for themselves . Mrs. Benson was always ready for them with plenty of work , when they had nothing to do . elsewhere . She made it for them , not that she had need of their aid , and so cheated them into the belief that they were indispensable for her comfort , while she was only ministering to theirs . V. Mrs. Flint was the housekeeper of Mrs. Benson . She had now held this situation for many years , never gaining the confidence of the lady whose domestic affairs she had superintended with so much zeal and discretion , as to render herself indispensable to the house . But she was very far from securing the affections of any of its inmates . A married daughter of hers in the village was even less a favorite than she , in the family of Mrs. Benson . Perhaps the evident partiality which Mrs. Benson had exhibited for the young ladies , who were now her protegfes , and her failure to interest Mrs. Benson in her daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enmity which she had cherished toward these girls ever since they had become the occasional members of the family . Yet it is needless to speculate upon the causes // which led to the indulgence of such feelings . A bad heart affords the only explanation of the phenomenon ; for such it certainly appears to any who came to the knowledge of the fact that a woman could cherish in her heart a desire to injure two unprotected orphans , whose helpless situation and exceeding innocence of character won for them the universal love and confidence of the community . Without stopping , therefore , to speculate upon the causes of her enmity , it is enough to say that she conceived and carried into execution a plan for the destruction of their character . She accused them to Mrs. Benson of having purloined many articles of clothing ; and when the declaration was made , and was received by Mrs. Benson with indignant exclamations of incredulity , she demanded that the basket which they had brought with them should be searched , and expressed her willingness to abide by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen one of them coming from the wardrobe in the morning , and under circumstances that left no doubt upon her own mind that she had been there for no proper purpose . More for the sake of convincing her housekeeper of the innocence of those whom she had so recklessly accused than with any idea of makin a discovery that should even awaken suspicion in her own mind , Mrs. Benson consented to the search ; and while the girls were engaged upon their work below , Mrs. Benson and the housekeeper proceeded to the apartment which had been occupied by the girls , where Mrs. Flint immediately produced from the bottom of the hasket the articles , of no great value , to be sure , but enough to fix upon them the guilt which Mrs. Flint had already imputed to them . Still Mrs. Benson was not satisfied . The confidence of years was not to be dashed , even by such a disclosure as this . But what could she say ? Mrs. Flint , with vehemence , insisted upon calling up the girls , setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , with the proof before their own eyes , to confess their guilt . Bewildered by the painful circumstances for which she was utterly unable to account , and hoping that they would be able to make some explanation of the unpleasant facts , Mrs. Benson consented to summon them to the chamber , and to hear from their own lips such explanation as they might be able to offer . At her call , they came bounding into the room , with conscious innocence in their faces , and wondering at the occasion of being summoned at such an hour to meet Mrs. Benson in their own room . She held up before them what would appear to be indisputable evidence that they had been seeking to rob their best friend ; and with tremblin* voice and tearful eyes , she begged them to tell her by what means these evidences of their wrong had thus been secreted . To her astonishment , they both received her inquiries and disclosures with a ringing laugh . This could mean only utter unconsciousness of evil , if it were not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When they came , however , to view the subject in a more serious light , and to perceive the necessity of giving some account of the circumstances in which they were involved , they could do nothing more than to declare their utter ignorance of the way and manner by which they had so suddenly come into possession ; and looking at Mrs. Flint , whose eyes fell to the floor when they attempted to catch her attention , they united in the declaration that some evil-disposed person must have secreted the articles among their things for the purpose of fastening upon them the suspicion of theft . Mrs. Flint declared that no one excepting herself and Mrs. Benson had been in the house , or had any access whatever to their apartments , and it was quite impossible to suppose that these things could be found there without hands ; and if not without hands , whose could they have been , unless those of the young ladies in whose possession these things had been so Jn-evideatially discovered ? " But how came they to be discovered ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Flint was unprepared ; but recovering herself , she said that , for some time pa*t , her suspicions had been excited by having missed various articles , which she had never mentioned to Mrs. Benson , and which she was resolved not to mention until she should be able to account for their disappearance ; that , accordingly , she had kept her eye upon the girls since they came into the house , and having noticed one of them this morning under circumstances that led her to suspect all was not right , she had taken the liberty , in their absence from the room , of examining the apartment , and this was the result ! Roused by a sense of the great injustice which had been done them , yet scarcely able to believe that so much malice could be in the human heart , unable to imagine a reason that could prompt any hdman being to devise and execute such a plan of mischief against them , they , nevertheless , in conscious innocence , united in charging upon Mrs. Flint , with courage which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having contrived this detestable scheme for their ruin ; and throwing themselves upon the mercy and upon the neck of Mrs. Benson , they begged her , for the sake of their mother , now in heaven , for their own sakeshelpless and friendless as they were in the world-not to believe this terrible charge , of which they declared themselves to he as guiltless as the spirit of her who bore them . Mrs. Benson believed them . With all the confidence of a mother , trusting in the purity of daughters whose every word and action she had known and loved from infancy , she took them to her heart , and assured them that , however dark the circumstances might appear , however difficult it might be to explain them , she would believe that God would yet make it plain , // and that whatever others might think , she for one would cherish no suspicion . This was a dark chapter in the history of the orphans . Hitherto misfortune had followed fast upon the heel of misfortune . The " clouds had returned after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been such as left them in the enjoyment of that priceless treasare-a character above reproach or suspicion . Now , the cloud that hung over them was darker than any which had ever yet obscured their path . For they hegan to feel how *vain would he all their own efforts to stem the tide of adversity , unless they had not only the present consciousness of virtue , hut the sweet assurance of the respect and confidence to which it would entitle them . It was a cheerless circle that surrounded the table at Mrs. Benson 's that evening ; few words were spoken , hut every heart was full of its own reflections upon the events of the day , and their probable influence upon the parties interested . Mrs. Benson 's mind was made up as to the course it was her duty to pursue , with reference to the woman , who , she had no doubt , was the evil * , enius in her house , and to whose malignant jealousy of the orphans she was compelled to attribute this fiendish attempt at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair as to prevent any future mischief resulting to them from the tongue of Mrs. Flint , when she should dispense with her services in the house . In the retirement of their chamher the sisters wept together over this new sorrow ; they sought strength from God , to whom alone they had learned to look for help in extremities ; and , hour after hour , as they lay in each other 's arms , they sought to cheer one another with words that did not speak the feelings of their hearts ; and it was not until long after midnight that disturbed sleep gave them a brief and imperfect respite from the grief now thickening around and upon them . It was impossible to escape the apprehension that Mrs. Benson 's confidence in their integrity had been shaken ; and they could not but feel that , were she lost to them , all on earth was lost ; and then , so often had they already been compelled to experience the failure of all earthly friendship , they would seek to persuade themselves that , even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be subjected , there was One ever above and near them , to whom they might flee for succor , and whose promises , made to their mother in her dying hour , would never fail . A few days afterward Mrs. Flint took her departure from the house of Mrs. Benson to her married daughter 's dwelling , and made it her home for the future . It was not long before the sisters found that her tongue was husy ; that she had correctly interpreted the reason of her dismissal ; and now , snore than she ever had done , sought to work their destruction for the sake of revenge . Whatever might have been the deficiency of motive in her case , when she first meditated mischief , she had now abundant excitement in the fact that the failure of her scheme had wrought her own injury . Stung by the mortification of her own discharge , she sought to expend the violence and hitterness of her own feelings in circulating , with malicious expedition , in the community the story , which would serve at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her own retirement from the service of Mrs. Benson . The girls saw the effects before they beard the cause . Friends in whose doors they had been welcomed now received them with coldness . Those who had sought their services now fell away , and they soon found themselves dependent most entirely upon their truly maternal friend , Mrs. Benson , who alone , of all the circle in which they had formerly been received , stood hy them . So wide-spread is the mischief which an evil report occasions ! It was in vain that Mrs. Benson asserted her belief in the innocence of the sisters . The community took the side of her whom they believed to have been unjustly accused ; and to have been discharged when all the evidences of wrong were against the parties whom Mrs. Benson had sheltered with what they believed an over-weenin , confidence . VI . So strong became the prejudice against these unfortunate girls , that their employment gradually fell oft until it became evident that they must he dependent upon Mrs. Benson for their daily bread , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable opportunity of sustaining themselves . Their friend and patron kindly assisted them in establishing themselves in a neighboring village , where it was believed they might be able to pursue their work , and by degrees gain the confidence of the community . But with a vindictiveness rarely to be found in the female sex , and painful to be contemplated wherever observed , Mrs. Flint followed them to their new home , and soon spread , in the community where they were now seeking to establish for themselves a character , the report that they bad been compelled to leave their native village under suspicions of dishonesty . They struggled heroically against this new dispensation of evil , but in vain . A few weeks had scarcely elapsed before it became evident that they would be utterly unable to make progress in this new . field , and that the few friends whom they had made were not proof against the insidious effects of slander , which was now undermining them . Indeed , so strong became the popular feeling of indignation against them , as suspicious and dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were unable to live in another where they were better known , that the house in which they lodged was surrounded by a mob , and demonstrations of violence were made ! When they beard the alarm which came up from the street , and were told that they were the occasion of the disturbance , tremblinn lest they might be the victims of personal violence , their fright became insup // portable . Mary , the less excitable of the two , sat moody and speechless . " They are coming ! " at last she exclaimed ; " they are coming for ns . We shall be driven out ; J ) erhaps we shall be killed . What shall we do ? " Sarah , more excited , but always more hopeful , strove to allay her alarm , beseeching her not to lose her trust in God , but to hope for the best . Through the help of the man whose house they were dwelling in , Sarah succeeded , after a while , in inducing the rioters in the street to retire , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day return to the village from which they had come . But they had to be taken there . And it was a month before that could be done . The fearful presentiment of some greater sorrow-the great black cloud-was made real-Mary was laid upon a bed of suffering with a brain fever , and Sarah was , by turns , a gentle and then a raving maniac ! God help the orphans ! yIJ . A year in their native village passes by . They are now hopelessly deranged . Wandering in the streets , singing loose and ribald songs  --  a source of intensest grief to all those who had known them in the loveliness of their childhood and youth-they were objects also of the tenderest compassion ; and had there been at this time any provision for the care and cure of the insane , doubtless they would have found a refnge in some such asylum . Human skill had not yet contrived such institutions , and the insane were only prevented from doing injuries to others by bela * con fined among the most miserable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no disposition to do violence to others , and were cheerful rather than gloomy in their madness , they were suffered to go at large ; and many sought , by kindness , to win them back again to a state of quietness and peace . Often , when led by the hand of friendship into the house of those who would care for them , they were known to leap from the windows into the street , as if apprehensive of being confined . As yet , they were never , even in their worst state , insensible to the voice of love . My own house was freely opened to them as a home , where I sought , by all the assiduity which my affection for their parents could suggest , to administer the balm of comfort , if I could not furnish the balm of healing , to their wounded minds . One instance occurs to me of peculiar interest . They were invited , as not unfrequently they had been before , to spend a social evening with some of the young people of the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening , their spirits seemed to revive . Something of their former gentleness and loveliness began to return . Yet now , so far had the work of ruin gone on in the minds of these young girls , that they not only had forgotten many of their early friends and associates , but , strange to say , they had forgotten the relationship between themselves . They knew each other only as companions . At the close of the evening , they were invited to spend the night at the house where the entertainment had been given ; and after retiring to bed , and lying in each other 's arms , soothed by the pleasures which they had been enjoying , and the circumstances of comfort by which they found themselves surrounded , a calm serenity of mind stole over them , fond memory came back with all its sweet influences , and gradually the truth broke in upon their souls that they were sisters ! In mutual recognition , and in the fullness of that affection , which had been uninterrupted from infancy , they spent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgetfnl , of course , of all that had occurred in the hours and months of their delirium ; yet remembering that some great sorrow had once shed its gloom over their minds , and that they were now in the midst of friends and l ) leasmes , which it was their privilege to enjoy . They rose in the morning refreshed by a night , not of sleep , but of sweet peace . Alas ! it was but for a night ! Before the day was gone , the cloud gathered over them once more ; delirium seized them ; they rushed forth from the house of their protector and friend , and again in the streets of the village , renewed their wild mirth , piercing the ears and the hearts of those who heard them . VIII . It was now late in the summer . Mrs. Flint had been for some weeks confined to her bed with a wasting fever . I was sent for to see her , and was out in the country visiting a parishioner some miles from my home . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was well convinced that her disease would have a fatal termination . As soon as I returned home and learned that I had been sent for , I hastened to the cottage ; as I entered , a scene of strange and thrilling interest was before my eyes . The woman was dying ; kneeling at her bedside were these two wild girls . I soon learned the facts that had brought them there under such strange and exciting circumstances . rhey bad been wandering , as usual , through the streets ; and when the sound of their mirth broke in upon the hearing of the dying woman , she inquired what it was . Being told that Sarah and Mary Bell were carmying on as they were accustomed to , she started at the mention of their names , and begged that they might be called in . They came at the call , and without hesitation a1 ) proached the bed on which their enemy and destroyer was now stretched , in hourly expectation of death . " I DID IT ! " said Mrs. Flint* , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ama now about to leave this world and go into the presence of God , I would not go without clearing these girls of that great sin which I laid to their charge , but which God knows they are as innocent of as the angels in his presence . I did it , I DID IT* it was all my work . " // The girls were evidently affected deeply by the sight before them , and the tones of her voice ; and as she repeated again and again her asseverations of their innocence and her own guilt , they began to comprehend the nature of the scene that was transpiring . It pleased God to give them just at this hour , and doubtless through the influence of the communication which they were receiving , at least a temporary deliverance from the darkness and delirium in which they had so long been lost . He restored peace and a measure of strength to their minds , enabling them to receive and to understand the blessed truth , that evidence was coming , thougl* from the verne of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had suffered . They took her extended hands in their own ; they knelt upon the floor by her side ; they assured her , even in their wretchedness and their ruin , that they would forgive her ; and they prayed Heaven to grant her forgiveness ere her soul should take its departure . It was at this juncture that I entered the room . The moment Mrs. Flint caught my eye she renewed her protestations of the innocence of the girls , told me how for years she had carried the pangs of remorse in her own breast how often she had desired to do them justice , and to seek peace for her own conscience ; but her selfishness and her pride had always overcome her better resolutions , and she had witnessed , month after month , the dreadful fruits of her sin , and feared continually that the judgments of God would overtake her . Here , on her sick bed , and in view of death , when no other considerations than those which attended preparation for the grand event which was just before her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been driven to this last and dying confession , which , while it would relieve her own mind of the burden under which she was sinking , would restore to those unhappy girls the priceless treasure of a character which they had lost ; thoug*h she believed , as I did , that it was too late to hope that the restoration of their character would bring them back the treasure of reason , which there was too much reason to fear was irretrievably lost . What could I add to this revelation , than which nothing could be more solemn or affecting ? Here were all the accessaries of a sublime , yet painful drama . The dying woman , with her sharp , haggard features , her piercing , agonized eyes , looking now at the girls , and now upward as if she would look into the other world , striving to read the destiny upon which she was about to enter , now turning to me with imploring glance , and asking me to direct her , even in her extremity , to some way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking to reassure the helpless daughters of sorrow yet kneeling before her , that God would be their father and their portion , saying that she could die with contentment if she could have some reason to believe that her death would be the means of giving back to them the life which they had lost . In vain was it for me to offer a word of consolation . Indeed , there was none to he spoken . I directed her , as I would any lost sinner in the hour of calamity , to the only refuge , and besought her to seek in the Saviour the only source of peace . When the girls arose from their knees , and were about to leave the house , she besought them to remain , and even required from them a promise that they would not leave her while she lived . With gentle kindness they began to perform the part of nurses around the sick-bed , and , with unaccustomed ministries , they soothed her sufferings , and gradually seemed to bring her to the enjoyment of something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paroxysms of anguish came back with redoubled force ; and in words too strong to be repeated , and such only as dying pains extort from consciences ill at ease anticipating greater anguish near at hand ; fearful of the present , and more fearful still of that which is to come , she cried again and again , " It was I that did it ; it was I that did it ; it was all my work . " And so she died . Ix . I took the girls home with me , and emhraced this present lucid interval to make a grand experiment , in the faint hope of securing their permanent restoration . Nothing had occurred since their derangement which afforded so good ground to believe that there might be a basis laid for a permanent cure . They could be assured that all suspicions formerly resting upon their character were now removed , and they would enjoy the universal confidence and love of those who had been their friends , and their mother 's friends , in the day of their prosperity and joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their home ; I gave them their chamber ; I gave them such light work as would occupy their minds , and in the cultivation of flowers in the garden , in the pursuit of such studies as they were always fond of and in the society of kind and genial friends , I sought to surround them with those pleasant influenceswhich would cheer and console , and gently aid in their perfect recovery . Among the many friends who were in the habit of visiting at my house , from the city of New York , was a merchant of large means and extensive business . His wife had died a year after their marriage , and he had led a single life for five or six years . It was not among the remotest of my suspicions that he should think of finding a second wife in my house , and in one of these unfortunate yet lovely young ladies . But there is no accounting for tastes or sympathies . Mr. Whitfield was a man long accustomed to think for himself , and not given to askin the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Then it was too late to shake his resolution , whatever the force of the motives urged against it . He knew the story of // the Bells , and that story had first awakened his sympathy , his pity , and prepared the way for love . V* hen he broached the subject to me , I begged him to dismiss it at once and forever from his mind . But he respectfully declined , telling me he had counted the cost , and was prepared for the risks . Although there had been great improvement in the health and appearance of both Sarah and Mary since the death of Mrs. Flint , they were still liable to returns of the fearful malady ; and Mr. Whitfield had his resolution put to the severest test , as soon as ho ventured upon the experiment of making known his intentions to Sarah , the object of his choice . He had invited her to ride with him . They drove out of the village , passing the door of the house in which Mrs. Flint had died . Sarah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her poor sister closed the eyes of the wretched woman . The memories of that scene , and of all they had passed through in the years of their former struggles and trials , came rushing upon her mind , and she began to talk wildly , and then madly ; and soon she became frantic , and strove to leap from the carriage , and would have done so but for the main force of her friend and companion , who trembled at the brink on which he was standing . Still he was not disheartened . He hastened back with his charge to my house , and told me of the excitement into which Sarah had been thrown , and the danger from which she had been rescued . He was deeply affected . He was in trouble . " And yet , " said he , " in spite of all this , I believe that if she were once more in a home of her own , and surrounded with the duties and pleasures of the household , her mind would become settled , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I assured him that , next to my own children , I desired their happiness before all others , hut I could not advise him to take a step which might make him miserable , without adding to the enjoyment of her , who could not be a wife such as he desired , unless God should give her hack the permanent possession of her once cultivated , and now disordered mind . He returned in a week or two , with his purpose unchanged . He asked Sarah again to ride with him ; and this time she seemed to enjoy the world around her , and to enter into the spirit of nature as its beauties met her eyes . The birds were happy , and she spoke of their gladness as she saw and heard them . The fields seemed to clap their hands . Sarah was joyful in the midst of a world of joy . They rode to Passaic Falls , at Patterson , in the State of New Jersey . The deep roar of the waters as they approached , was a solemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out upon the wide flat rocks through which the river makes its broken plunge , and instead of being terrified she gloried in the excitement of the scene . She spoke of the spray as a cloud of incense rising from these eternal altars , and ever praising Him who sits in the heavens , and listens to the music of all his works . They came to the edge of the precipice , and Mr. Whitfield pointed out to her the very spot where , a few months previously , a bride had fallen from the side of her husband , and had been dashed to pieces on the rocks below . She looked down with steady nerves , and said that it was a fearful fall , and more fearful to him who remained when his bride was gone ! He led her cautiously , and by a winding path to the bottom of the ravine , whence they could look up to the brow of the black jagged rocks , from which the white waters were tumbling through the green fringes of stunted trees and bushes that clung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the roar of the fall , as she was rejoicing in the wonderful beauty of the scenes around her , he began his declaration . " You are not serious , surely , " she cried , in mingled fear and surprise , as he intimated that he desired her love , and would be only too happy to give her his fortune and his hand . " You do not know my story , or you could not dream of such a proposal . " " I know it all ; it was that story which first led me to think of devoting my life to yours ; and if you will cast in your lot with me , you shall find that I will be parent , brother , husband , all in one . " " It is altogether out of the question , " she returned . " I do not love you ; I do not know that I could love . This thought of love is one that I have not known since those happy days before the clouds came . You did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heard that one all unworthy of you once sought you , and that he fled when the day of your adversity came . I would come to you in the midst of your sorrow , and win you to a home of peace and joy . I have the means of surrounding you with all that you can desire , and my life shall be spent in making yours as happy as you ever dreamed of being . " " But ybn have not counted the cost ; you know not what you are proposing ; I am a poor , weak thing ; and I have even been told that my sister and I are sometimes deranged . I do not know what it is , or why it is , but I have strange , dreadful thoughts sometimes ; and these have been more frequent and more terrible since the time when Mary and I were accused of a crime of which we were altogether innocent . You will not be so rash as to think of taking such a wild , thoughtless woman as I am to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affection you promise could be returned in all its sincerity and strength . " Still he pressed his suit . In the honesty of his heart he felt he had now committed himseW and even if he had been staggered in his purpose by the serious objections she had so rationally raised , and urged with so much earnestness , he was hound to go forward . And never did the girl appear to him more lovely than when , with such delicate appreciation of his motives , and tempted as she must be by his // proposals , she still resisted his appeals , and left him an open door to retreat . He renewed his entreaties . " But there is my sister Mary , who was with me in our childhood , the companion of all my sorrows-I will never , never leave her . " " And you shall not leave her . She will go with us to our own home , and he my sister as well as yours . Instead of losing a sister , she will find a brother . " Sarah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in this thing , and that the dark clouds which had so long hung over her were now clearing away , and a new light was breaking upon her path . Yet she could not yield to the offers so pressed upon her till she had consulted her friends , and she finally promised to he governed by my advice iu the matter . She was calm and cheerful as they came home together that evening . I should not have suspected that any thing unusual had passed between them . But after the sisters had retired for the night , and I was left alone with Mr. Whitfield , lie told me of the events of the day , and begged me to aid him in procuring Sarah 's consent to their union . He knew well that I had already advised him against the proposal ; but now he was more than ever infatuated with the conviction , that the restoration of the sisters to the calm pleasures of a house they might call their own , would he the means of getting them health and pence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was obliged to tell him that it was impossible for me to object , if he was willing to take the responsibility upon himself . With a new and admiring sense of the ways of Divine Providence , I looked upon the change that was about to take place in the situation of these poor sisters , and said to myself seriously , as I thought over the ways by which they had been led , is there , indeed , any thing too hard for the Lord ? Who would have believed that such a door of deliverance from poverty and suffering would he opened ? Who would have thought that one of these orphans , a few months ago , wandering in the streets , and raving in the wildness of delirium , would now he songht after by a man of character and wealth , laying his fortune at her feet , and offering to share his house with her sister , so that both should be equally the recipients of blessings which Heaven is so kindly bestowing ? Here was the promise of God most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will keep them alive ; " " When my father and my mother forsake me , then the Lord *viil take me up . " There had been many long and painful years , when it might be feared that these promises had been forgotten . So deep had been the extremity of their destitution , and so hopeless their condition , I had looked forward to their death as the first release they could have from sorrow . Such a termination was far more probable than that one of them should win the love of a noblehearted man who would take her to hixnself and surround her with the sweets of social and domestic life . But if all this is , indeed , in store for these orphan sisters , far be it from me to say a word , except to pray God to bless them both , and give them a respite from the miseries which have so long been their portion . During the interval of three months that followed this eventful day , there was a daily and marked improvement in time sisters . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , returned ; they were themselves again . And when Sarah at length gave her consent , and stood up before me to he joined in marriage to the man who had thus nobly called her to be his own , I said to him , " I give you Sarah to he your wife , and Mary to be your sister . " And he replied , " I will be faithful to both until death shall separate us . " If any part of this narrative has had the appearance of romance , much more like it is that which is now to be recorded . But if I have not already given the assurance , it may be well to say here , that I am following out the events of real life , and there are many now living who will read and attest , if needful , the truth of these strange facts . Among the guests at the marriage of Sarah was a younger brother of her husband , his partner in business , and with the same bright prospects . He stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported by her sister . In less than a month from that time the order was changed , and the younger Whitfield and Mary stood side by side , and plighted their vows in the presence of God , and surrounded by a glad and admiring circle of friends , who could not conceal their grateful recognition of a merciful providence in the marriage of these two sisters under circumstances of such extraordinary interest . A short time afterward I saw them settled in their new homes . They lived in adjoining houses in one of the pleasantest streets of the city , then quite down town , where now the march of business has driven out the old settlers , desecrated the firesides hallowed by a thousand sacred associations , and converted the sanctuary of love into temples of Mammon. x . And here I would be willing to close this record , and leave my young friends in the bliss with which at length their lives are crowned . " It is wonderful , " Sarah said to me as I called to see her in her beautiful mansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led us , and now we are as happy as we have ever been miserable in the years that are past ! Do you believe that my dear mother knows what we have passed through , and what we are enjoying now ? " I told her I had often indulged the idea that the spirits of the departed were conversant with our spirits-that they are indeed ministering spirits to those whom they loved while in the flesh , and it was not impossible that her mother had followed her in all her eventful and mys // t.erious history . Even now she may be near and rejoicing that peace and joy had at last visited the hearts of her daughters , and out of great tribulation they were already brought to happiness they had never dreamed of . It was a short year after Mary 's marriage when the birth of a child promised to fill the cup of her thanksgiving . Others rejoiced , and vet she did not seem to be happy in the prospect , nor when it was laid in her arms , did she give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fondling it with the yearning tenderness of a young mother , she looked on it calmly , but with a fixedness of interest , that was snore full of anxiety than affection . Days and weeks went by and this moodiness increased . She was able now to sit up , and when the infant was lying on her knees or in the cradle hy her side , she would sit by the hour and watch it steadily , without a word , but often sighing as if some great sorrow was in the future of her child 's history , into which she was lookin* . Slowly but steadily and in the lapse of weeks and months , she sank into melancholy gloom . No art of medicine , no kind devotion of a faithful husband , no swect ministries of a large and loving circle of friends could raise her up , or dispel the cloud that gathered over her spirit . The child was removed from her sight , hut it was all the same to her . She never asked for it , seemed never to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foreign travel was proposed , and Mr. Whitfield earnestly strove to prevail on her to go with him abroad . But to all such invitations she was indifferent . She must have been carried by force , or she would never have been taken from the room where in profound reverie she sat , day after day , without interest in the world around her , or even in those nearest to her fireside . Sarah was not careless for her sister 's state , hut alas , by that strange fatality which had hitherto followed them both , making them one in suffering as they were also one in the few joys that were theirs in life , she too , began to show signs of returning madness ! What was the secret principle thus linking their destinies ? In childhood they had been as one in love and innocence . In youth they had been crushed , together and by the same blow . In womanhood they had both found loving hearts , fraternal hearts , that gave them a shelter , a home , and all the sympathies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great struggle of life was past , and they were in the midst of joys that even in the dreams of childhood they had never thought of , the darkness is coming on again , and other hearts besides their own are to he shrouded in the approaching gloom . Marx 's child died in its first year . Mary did not shed a tear . It was no more to her than the child of a stran ner . She was now silent and sullen . She never complained , but it was gradually apparent that disease was making , pro*re5s . She took to her bed , and a slow fever wore out her life . She died three months after her child , and less than two years after her marriage . Sarah 's malady had a widely different development . Naturally more excitable than her sister , she had in former days been more wild and gay in the seasons of their derangement . Now she was wilder than ever . She became uncontrollable by the friends who surrounded her . There was no asylum into which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were confined only among paupers or criminals , or in hospitals under circumstances the most unfavorable to their recovery . Her faithful husband , as tender in his affections and devoted as when be first won her , sought to restrain her hy gentle assiduity , striving to conceal from others , when he could no longer hide frem his own mind , the terrible fact that she was mad . But her madness wore a humorous rather than a mischievous type for some months . She would enter the parlor while he was on his knees conducting the devotions of the household , and leap on his back as if in the exuberance of childish spirits , and frolic there , laughing while his heart was breaking . They put a strait-waistcoat upon her , but she would contrive to get it off and throw it through the xvindow , and threaten to leap out herself if it was ever put on her again . The Hospital in Broadway at the head of Pearl Street was then new , and after long hesitation , and acting under the advice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon to consent to her removal there . He obtained the most desirable apartment on the southeast corner , in one of the upper stories ; and having furnished it with every appliance for her safety and comfort , he consigned her to the care of the medical men in that institution when it was no longer possible for him to keep her in any comfort at home . But he could not rest in his own mansion while the wife of his bosom , whom he so tenderly loved , was in a public hospital , alone and crazed . Night after night be walked the street in front of the building in which she was confined , looking up at the window in her narrow chamber , sometimes fancying that he saw her struggling to force her way through , and expecting to see her Ilunging headlong from that fearful height . By degrees her strength gave way ; and when she was no longer able to be violent in her paroxysms of madness , he had the melancholy satisfaction of again taking her to his own house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her , and thither she was conveyed , and watched by suitable attendants . When by the silence of her chamber he knew that she was asleep , he would often steal up from his own room , and sitting down in a large easy chair near the bed , he would look upon the wreck of his lovely bride , weeping over the change , and praying that even now , in her hopeless and helpless state , the power of God might be revealed for relief and restoration . The first sweet years of their union would then // cease to his memory , when something whispered to him of his rashness in linking to himself one whose mind was shattered , whatever might be her virtues and her charms ; and he thanked God that it had been his privilege , even for that brief period , to make her a home , and fill her heart with peace and joy . One night he was sitting there , and musing , perhaps somewhat encouraged by having been told that through the day she had been calmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping , more sweetly than he had known her in many months . And as he leaned his head back in the chair , wearied with long and anxious waking , he fell asleep . When he awoke , his wife was sitting on his knees ; her arms were around his neck . She pressed her lips to his , and said to him , " My dear , dear husband . " It was the first recognition of many long and awful months . He pressed her warmly , convulsively to his heart . " Sing to me , " she said ; " sing to me one of those Sabbath evening songs . " " I can not sing , dearest , " he replied ; " it is enonab that you are mine again , and here , here on my breast , dearest , sweetest wife . " Her head fell on his shoulder , and he poured into her ear the glowing words of his love . " Oh , these months of wretchedness , when you could not know that I loved you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , if God will spare you , as he has restored you to my arms . Kiss me again , sweet wife . " She did not speak . " Kiss me , love . " Her head still rested on his shoulder . He raised her up to press his lips to hers . She was dead !
