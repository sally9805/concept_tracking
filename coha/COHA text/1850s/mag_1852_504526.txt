NEW MONTHLY MAGAZINE , No . XXIX. - OCTOBER , 185*. - Voi . V. MEMOIRS OF THE HOLY LAND. * BY JACOB ABBOTT . THE DEAD SEA . SODOM AND GOMORRAH . OW associated in the minds of men , IT * are s of guilt and ruin , unspeakable and awful , with the names of Sodom and Gomorrah . The very words themselves seem deeply and indelibly imbued with a mysterious and dreadful meaning . The account ' given in the Sacred Scriptures of the destruction of these cities , and of the circumstances connected with it , has , perhaps , exercised a greater influence in modifying , or , rather , in forming , the conception which has been since entertained among mankind in respect to the character of God , than any other one portion of the sacred narrative . The thing that is most remarkable about it is , that while in the destruction of the cities we have a most appalling exhibition of the terrible energy with which God will punish confirmed and obdurate wickedness , we have in the attendant circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind , and tender , and merciful regard with which he will protect , and encourage , and sustain those who are attempting , however feebly , to please him , and to do his will . We are told elsewhere in the Scriptures , didactically , that God is love , and also that he is a consuming fire . In this transaction we see the gentleness and the tenderness of his love , and the terrible severity of his retributive justice , displayed together . Let us examine the account somewhat in detail . " And the Lord said , Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great , arid because their sin is very grievous , " I will go down now , and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it , which is come unto me ; and if not , I will know . " - Gen. xviii . 20 , 21 . There is a certain dramatic beauty in the manner in which the designs and intentions of Jehovah are represented in such cases as this , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very frequently by the Hebrew writers , being far more spirited and graphic than the ordinary mode of narration , and more forcible in its effect upon common minds that are not accustomed to abstractions and generalizations . Thus , instead of saying , And God determined to create man , it is , And God said , I will make man . In the same manner , where a modern historian in speaking of the discovery of America would have written : Columbus , having learned that trunks of trees were brought by western winds to the shores of Europe , inferred that there was land in that direction , and resolved to go in search of it , a Hebrew writer would have said , And it was told to Columbus , that when western winds had long been blowing , trees were thrown up upon the European shores ; and Columbus said , I will take vessels and men and go and search for the land whence these trees come . The verses which we have quoted above , accordingly , though in form ascribing words to Jehovah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manner adapted to the conceptions of men , the cautious and deliberate character of the justice of God . " I have heard the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah , the cry of grievous violence and guilt , and I will go down and see if the real wickedness that reigns thqre , is as great as would seem to be denoted by the cry . And if not , I will know . " In other words , God would not condemn hastily . He would not judge from appearances , since appearances might be fallacious . He would cautiously inquire into all the circumstances , and even in the case of wickedness so enormous as that of Sodom and Gomorrah , he would carefully ascertain whether there were any considerations that could extenuate or soften it . How happy would it be for mankind , if we all , in judging our neighbors , would follow the example of forbearance and caution here presented to us . It was undoubtedly with reference to its influence as an example for us , that the sacred writer has thus related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrative which is given of the earnest intercession made by Abraham , to save the cities , and of the apparent yielding of the Almighty Judge , again and again , to humble prayers in behalf of sinners , offered by a brother sinner , illustrates the long-suffering and the forbearance of God-his reluctance to punish , and his readiness to save . There is a special charm in the exhibition which is made of these divine attributes in this case , assuming the form as they do of a divine sympathy with the compassionate impulses of man . The great and almighty Judge allows himself to be led to deal mercifully with sinners through * Entered , according to Act of Congress , in the year 1852 , by Harper and Brothers , in the Clerk 's Olilce of the District Court of the Southern District of New York .

The intercession of Abraham was after all unavailing , for there were not ten righteous men to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the promise that the city should be spared . The narrative , however , of the intercession , the final result of it in the promise of God to spare the whole monstrous mass of wickedness , if only ten righteous men could be found in the city , and the measures which he adopted , when it was ascertained that there were not ten to be found , to warn and rescue all that there were , give to the whole story a great power in bringing home to the hearts of men , a sense of the compassion of God , and the regard which he feels for human sympathies and desires . There is no portion of the sacred Scriptures which has more encouraged and strengthened the spirit of prayer , than the narration of the circumstances that preceded the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. 5ITUATION OF THE PLAIN . Sodom and Gomorrah are described as the cities of the plain , and this plain is spoken of as the plain of Jordan . And yet the place where the cities are supposed to have stood , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jordan empties into the northern end of it . If , therefore , the plain on which the cities stood was the plain of the Jordan , in the time of Lot , it would seem that the sea itself could not have existed then , but that the river must have continued its flow , beyond the point which now forms the southern termination of the sea . The sea as at present existing , is bounded on both sides by ranges of lofty and precipitous mountains , which lie parallel to each other , and extend north and south for several hundred miles . The space which lies between these ranges , forms a long and narrow ravine , very deeply depressed below the ordinary level of the earth 's surface , as if it were an enormous crevasse , with the bed of it filled up to a certain level , in some places with water and in others with alluvial soil , either fertile or barren according to the geological structure of the different sections of it . This remarkable ravine divides itself naturally into five sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains the sources of the Jordan , and the lakes Merom and Tiberias . The second is the valley of the Jordan . Here the bottom of the ravine consists of a long and narrow plain of fertile land , with the river meandering through it . The third section is the bed of the Dead Sea . The waters here fill the whole breadth of the valley so completely , that in many places it is impossible to pass along the shore between the mountains and the sea . The water is deepest near the northern part of the sea , and grows more and more shallow toward the southern part , until at length the land rises above the level of the surface of the water , and then the bottom of the ravine presents again a plain of land , instead of a sheet of water . This is the fourth section . It extends , perhaps , a hundred irdies , rising gradually all the way , and forming in summer the bed of a small stream which flows northward to the Dead Sea . This part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * At length the level of the bottom of the valley reaches its highest point , and the land descends again to the south , forming the fifth or southernmost section of the vast crevasse . The waters of the Red sea flow up some hundred miles into this section . forming the eastern one of the two forks into which that sea divides itself , at its northernmost extremity . It will be seen thus that it is at the Dead Sea that the depression of the valley is the greatest . In fact , the bed of the valley descends in both directions toward the Dead Sea for a hundred miles . Some writers have supposed that the whole of this depression was produced at the time of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah , and that previous to that time , the Jordan continued its course through the whole length of the valley to the Red Sea , being bordered throughout this whole distance by fertile plains extending on either hand from its banks to the base of the mountains ; and that it was on this plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Dead Sea , that the cities Sodom and Gomorrah , Admah and Zeboim , were built . In adopting this hypothesis we must suppose that the destruction of the cities was attended with some volcanic convulsion , by which all that part of the valley was sunk so far below its natural level that the river could no longer continue its course . The waters then , we must imagine , gradually filled up the deep bed so suddenly made for them , until the surface , became so extended that the evaporation from it was equal to the supply from the river ; and thus the sea was formed , and its size and configuration permanently determined . Others supposed that the sea existed from the most ancient times substantially as at present , occupying the whole breadth of the valley , from side to side , though not extending so far to the southward as now . On tb.is supposition the cities destroyed were situated* a fertile plain which then bordered the southern extremity of the sea , but which is now submerged by its waters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypotheses , if either , is correct . A much greater physical change is implied in the former than in the latter supposition , but perhaps the latter is not on that account any the less improbable . When the question is of an actual sinking of the earth , whether we suppose the causes to be miraculous or natural , it is as easy to conceive of a great subsidence , as of a small one . The enlargement of a sea , whether by the agency of an earthquake , or by the direct power of God , is as great a wonder as the creation of it would be . THE DEsTRUCTION OF THE CITIES . The account given by the sacred writers of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah is this . Lot was dwelling , at the time , in Sodom . He was warned by the messengers of God , that the city was to be destroyed , and was directed to * Wadi Arabah. // make his escape from it with all his family , daughters , and his daughters could not go withThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their husbands . The two messengers urged He went out immediately to the houses of his him not to delay . They entreated him to take sons-in-law , to communicate the awful tidings his daughters with him and go , before the fated to them and to summon them to flee . They hour should arrive . Finally they took him by however did not believe him . They ridiculed the hand , and partly by persuasion and partly by his fears and refused to accompany him in his force , they succeeded in bringing him out of the flight . Lot returned to his house much troubled city . His wife and his daughters accompanied and perplexed . He could not go without his him . His sons-in-law , it seems , were left behinO It was very early in the morning when Lot came forth from the city-not far from the break of day . As soon as he was without the walls , the messengers urged him not to tarry there or imagine that he was yet safe , but to press forward with all speed , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said they " Look not behind thee , neither stay thou in all the plain ; escape to the mountain lest thou be consumed . " Lot was , however , afraid to go into the mountains . They were wild and desolate . His wife and his daughters were with him and it was yet dark . To take so helpless a company into such solitudes at such a time , seemed awful to him , and he begged to be permitted to retire to Zoar . Zoar was a small town on the eastern side of the plain , just at the foot of the mountains , at a place where a lateral valley opened , through which a stream descended to the plain . Lot begged that he might be permitted to go to Zoar , and that that city might be spared . His prayer was granted . A promise was given him that Zoar should be saved , and lie was directed to proceed thither without delay . He accordingly went eastward across the plain and reached Zoar , just as the sun was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her husband , lingered and loitered on the way , and was lost . The words are , " She became a pillar of salt . " Precisely what is intended by this expression is somewhat uncertain ; at any rate she was destroyed . and Lot escaped with his daughters alone into Zoar . Immediately afterward Sodom and Gomorrah were overwhelmed . The description of the catastrophe is given in the following words : " The Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven . " And he overthrew those cities and all the plain , and all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew upon the ground . " And Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord : " And he looked toward Sodom and Gomarrah. // and toward all the land of the plain , and beheld , us , therefore , where a miraculous effect is deand lo , the smoke of the country went up as the scribed , to look into the natural laws related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 , 27 , 28. it , for the sake of observing whatever of analogy or conformity between the causes and effects may really appear . With reference to such analogies , the character and the physical constitution of the gorge in which the Dead Sea lies , has excited great interest in every age . The valley has been generally considered as of volcanic formation , though it is somewhat doubtful how far it is strictly correct thus to characterize it , since no signs of lava or of extinct craters appear in any part of it . The whole region , however , is subject to earthquakes , and many substances that are usually considered as volcanic productions are found THE PLA* .. here and there along the valley , PHILO5OP qwq ty herbage which grew in them . Now and then some party of Crusaders , or some solitary pilgrim travelers , descended the valley from the fords of the Jordan , till they reached the sea  --  or looked down upon it from some commanding position among the mountains , on the eastern or western sides  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its southern shores to procure salt for the people of the interior . Through these and other similar channels , vague and uncertain tidings of the deadly influences of the sea and of the awful solitude and desolation which reigned around it , came out , from time to time , to more frequented regions , whence they spread in strange and exaggerated rumors throughout the civilized world . It was said that the waters of the sea filled the gloomy valley which they occupied with influences so pestiferous and deadly that they were fatal to every species of life . No fish could swim in them , no plant could grow upon their shores . It was death for a man to bathe in them , or for a bird to fly over them ; and even the breezes which blew from them toward the land , blighted and destroyed all the vegetation that they breathed upon . The surface and margin of the water , instead of being adorned with verdant islands , or fringed with the floating vegetation of other seas , was blackened with masses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winds , or was bordered with a pestiferous volcanic scum ; while all the approaches to the shores in the valley below were filled with yawning pits of pitchy slime , which engulfed the traveler in their horrid depths , or destroyed his life by their poisonous and abominable exhalations . In a word , the valley of the Dead Sea was for two thousand years regarded as an accursed ground , from which the wrath of God , continually brooding over it , sternly excluded every living thing . Within the last half century , however , many scientific travelers have visited the spot , and have brought back to the civilized world more correct information in respect to the natural history of the valley . BUaCKHARDT 5 VIsIT TO THE VALLEY OF AEABAH . One of the earliest of the scientific travelers , to whom we have alluded , was John Lewis Burckhardt , who spent several years , in the early part of the present century , in exploring the countries around the southeastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea , under the auspices THE VALLEY OF ARABAH. qwq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and customs of the people , so that in traveling through the countries which he was intending to explore , he might pass for a native , and thus be allowed to go where he pleased without molestation . He succeeded perfectly in attaining this object . He acquired the Arabic language , assumed the Arabic dress , and learned to accommodate himself , in all respects , to the manners and customs of the country . He thus passed without hindrance or suspicion where no known European or Christian would have been allowed to go . Burckhardt explored the valley of Arabah , which extends from the Dead Sea to the Red Sea , forming , as has already been said , a southem continuation of the great Jordan gorge . He was , in fact , the first to bring the existence of this southern valley to the notice of the civilized world . The valley of the Jordan , as he describes it , widens about Jericho , where the hills which border it , join the chains of mountains which inclose the Dead Sea . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving between them a valley or Ghor , similar in form to the northern Ghor , through which the Jordan flows ; though the southern valley , from want of water , is a desert , while the Jordan and its tributaries make the other a fertile plain . In the southern Ghor , the rivulets which descend from the mountains are lost in the sand and gravel which form their beds , long before they reach the valley below . The valley itself , therefore , is entirely without water , and is , consequently , barren and desolate . The whole plain , as Burckhardt viewed it , presented the // son , preclude the growth of every species of herbage . A few Bedouin tribes encamp in the valley in the winter , when the streams from the mountains being full , a sufficient supply of water is produced to flow down into the valley , causing a few shrubs to grow , on which the sheep and goats can feed . Burckhardt and his party were an hour and a half in crossing the valley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tour , and they found the heat almost intolerable . There was not the slightest appearance of a road or of any other work of man at the place where they crossed it . Still they met with no difficulty in prosecuting their journey , for the sand , though deep , was firm , and the camels walked over it without sinking . In the various journeys which Burckhardt made in these solitary regions , he carefully noted all that he saw , and copious reports of his observations were afterward published by the society in whose service he was engaged . The only instrument which he had , however , for making observations , was a pocket compass , and this he was obliged to conceal in the most careful manner from his Arab attendants , for fear of betraying himself to them . If they had seen such an instrument in his possession , they would not only have suspected his true character , but would have believed the compass to be an instrument of magic , and would have been overwhelmed with superstitious horror at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only to keep his compass in concealment , as he journeyed , but also to resort to a great variety of contrivances and devices to make observations with it without being seen . Sometimes , when riding on horseback , he would stop for a moment in the way , and watching a opportunity when the attention of his companions was turned in another direction , would hastily glance at his compass unseen , covering it , while he did so , beneath his wide Arabian cloak . When riding upon a camel he could not adopt this method , for a single camel in a caravan can not be induced to stop while the train is going on . To meet this emergency , the indefatigable traveler learned to dismount and mount again without arresting the progress of the animal . He would descend to the ground , and straying away for a moment into a copse of bushes , or behind some angle of a rock , would crouch down , take out his compass , ascertain the required bearing , make a note of it secretly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pocket of his vest , and then returning to the camel , would climb up to his seat and ride on as before . It was by such means as these that the existence and the leading geographical features of the valley of Arabah were first made known to the Christian world . ROBINSON 5 VISIT TO EN-GEDI . Edward Robinson is a distinguished American philosopher and scholar , who has devoted a great deal of attention to the geography and history of Palestine , and whose researches and explorations have perhaps accomplished more in throwing light upon the subject , than those of any other person , whether of ancient or modern times . He has enjoy*d very extraordinary facilities foi accomplishing his work ; for , in his character , and in the circumstances in which he has been placed , there have been combined , in a very remarkable degree , all the qualifications , and all the opportunities necessary for the successful prosecution of it . Having been devoted , during the greater portion of his life , to the pursuit of philological studies , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as of the manners and customs of the East ; and , being endued by nature with a temperament in which great firmness and great steadiness of purpose are combined with a certain quiet and philosophical calmness and composure , and a quick and discriminating apprehension with caution , prudence , and practical good sense , he is very eminently qualified for the work of an Oriental explorer . In the year 1838 , he made an extended tour , or , rather , series of tours , in the Holy Land , a very minute and interesting report of which he afterward gave to the world . He is now , in 1852 , making a second journey there ; and the Christian world are looking forward , with great interest , to the result of it . During Robinson 's first tour in Palestine , he made an excursion from Jerusalem to the western shores of the Dead Sea , where he visited a spot which is marked by ' a small tract of fertile ground , under the cliffs on the shore , known in ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the present day Am Jidy . From Jerusalem he traveled south to Hebron , and thence turning to the east , he traversed the mountains through a succession of wild and romantic passes which led him gradually toward the sea . The road conducted him at length into the desolate and rocky region called in ancient times the Wilderness of En-gedi , the place to which David retreated when pursued by the deadly hostility of Saul . It was here that the extraordinary occurrences took place that are narrated in 1 Sam . xxiv . David , in endeavoring to escape from his enemy , hid in a cave . Saul , in pursuing him , came to the same cave , and being wearied , lay down and went to sleep there . While he was asleep , David , coming out , secretly cut off the skirt of his robe , without attempting to do him any personal injury ; thus showing conclusively that he bore him no ill-will . Robinson found the region full of caves , and the scenery corresponded , in all other respects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . view OF THE SEA . As our traveler and his party journeyed on toward the sea , they found the country descending continually , and as they followed the road down the valleys and ravines through which it lay , they imagined that they had reached the level of the sea , long before they came in sight of its shores . At length , however , to their astonishment , they came suddenly out upon the brow of a mountain , from which they looked down into a deep and extended valley where the broad expanse of water lay , fifteen hundred feet below them . The surprise which they experienced at finding the sea at so much lower a level than their estimate made it , illustrates the singular accuracy of Robinson 's ideas in respect to the . topography of the country which he was exploring ; for , if the Dead Sea had been really at the same level with the Mediterranean , as was then generally supposed to be the case , it would have presented itself to the party of travelers precisely as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was owing to a very extraordinary depression of the valley , the existence and the measure of which has since been ascertained . Robinson and his companions , from the summit of a small knoll which lay on one side of their path , looked down upon the vast gulf beneath them with emotions of wonder and awe . It was the Dead Sea which they saw extended before them . There it lay , filling the bottom of its vast chasm , and shut in on both sides by ranges of precipitous mountains , whose steep acclivities seemed sometimes to rise directly from the water , though here and there they receded a little from the shore , so as to leave a narrow beach beneath the rocks below . From the point where our observers stood the whole southern half of the sea was exposed to view . The northern part was partly concealed by a precipitous promontory , called Ras Mersed , which rose abruptly from the shore a little north of their position . The southern part of the sea , as viewed from this point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared projecting inmanyplaces from the shore , forming long and low points and peninsulas ) f sandy land . There was one very large and remarkable peninsula of higher land , in the southgist part of the sea . The posim and configuration of this peninsula may be seen upon the map . It is formed in some respect like a human foot , with the heel toward the sea . Of course , the ankle of the foot is the isthmus which connects the peninsula with the main land . The length of this pcninsula , from north to south , is live or six miles . Our observers , from their lofty position at En-gedi , looked down upon it , and could trace almost the whole of its outline . North of it , too , there was a valley , which opened up among the mountains to the eastward , called the Valley of Kerak . At the head of this valley , several miles from the shore of the sea , lies the town of Kerak. a place sometimes visited by pilgrims and travelers , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country on a line parallel to the shore of the sea . The course of the valley was such that the position of our observers on the mountain at En-gedi commanded a full view of the whole extent of it . They could even see the town of Kerak , with its ancient castle on a rock-far up near the summit of the mountain . It is in the lower part of this valley , a little to the eastward of the isthmus which has been already described , that the town of CAVE5 OF EN-OEDI. // Zoar stood , as it is supposed , where Lot sought refuge at the time of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah . THE PASS . After remaining on the cliff about three quarters of an hour , to observe and to record every thing worthy of notice in the extended view before them , the party began to go down the pass to the shore . The descent was frightful , the pathway having been formed by zigzags down the cliff , the necessary width for the track having been obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sometimes by means of rude walls THE DESCENT . built from below . As they looked back up the roeks after they had descended , it seemed impossible to them that any road could have been formed there  --  and yet so skillfully had the work been planned and executed , that the descent , though terrific , was accomplished without any serious difficulty . In fact , the road was so practicable , that loaded camels sometimes passed up and down . One of Mr. Robinson 's companions had crossed the heights of Lebanon and the mountains of Persia , and he himself had traversed all the principal passes of the Alps , but neither of them had ever met with a pass so difficult and dangerous as this . The way was really dangerous as well as difficult . An Arab woman , not long before the time of Robinson 's visit , in descending the road , had fallen off over the brink of the precipice to the rocks below . She was , of course , killed by the fall . After descending for about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of dell , where a copious and beautiful fountain , springing forth suddenly from a recess in the rock , formed at once an abundant stream , that flowed tumultuously down a narrow ravine toward the sea , still four hundred feet below . This fount was the Am Jidy , the word Am signifying fountain in the Arabic tongue The meaning of the whole name is the fountain of the kzd . The course of the stream in its descent from its source was hidden from view by a luxuriant thicket of trees and shrubs which grew along its bed , nourished by the fertilizing influence of the waters . The party halted at the spring , and pitched their tents , determining to make their encampment at this spot with a view of leaving their animals here and going down on foot to the shore below . They had originally intended not to go up the pass again , but to proceed to the northward along the shore of the sea , having been informed that they could do so . They now learned , however , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they must reascend the mountain in order to continue their journey . They accordingly determined , for the purpose of saving the transportation of their baggage up and down , to encamp at the fountain . While pitching their tents , an alarm was given , that some persons were coming down the pass , and , on looking upward , they saw at the turns of the zigzag , on the brow of the precipice far above , two or three men , mounted and armed with guns . The party were for a moment alarmed , supposing thatthe strangers might be robbers . Their true character , however , very soon appeared ; for , as they drew near , they were found to be a troop of laboring peasants of the neighborhood , mounted on peaceful donkeys , and coming down to the shore in search of salt ; and so the alarm ended in a laugh . The party of peasants stopped a short time at the fountain to rest , and then continued their descent to the shore . They gathered the salt , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea ; for the waters of the sea are so impregnated with saline solutions , that whenever pools of it are evaporated by the sun , along the shore , inllorescences and incrustations remain , which can be easily gathered . After a time , the train of donkeys , bearing their heavy burdens , went toiling up the steep ascent again , and disappeared . THE SHORE OF THE SEA . After remaining for some time at the encampment , Robinson and his companions set out at five o'clock , to go down to the shore . The declivity was still steep , though less so than in th' pass above The ground was fertile , and bore many plants and trees , and the surface of it appeared to have been once terraced for tillage and gardens . At one place , near the foot of the descenf , were the ruins of an ancient town . From the base of the declivity , there was a rich and fertile plain which lay sloping gradually nearly half a mile to the shore . The bed of the brook could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the season of this visit , the waters which the fountain supplied , copious as they appeared where they first issued from the rock , were absorbed by the earth long before they reached the shore . The rivulet , therefore , of Am Jidy is the most short-lived and transitory of streams . It breaks forth suddenly from the earth at its fountain , and then , after tumbling and foaming for a short distance over its rocky // bed , it descends again into the ground , disappearing as suddenly and mysteriously as it came into being . The plain which this evanescent stream thus gave up its life to fertilize , was all under cultivation at the time that Robinson visited it , being t*ivided into gardens , which belonged to a certain tribe of wandering Arabs . This tribe were , however , not now encamped here , but had gone away to a tract of ground belonging to them in another part of the country , having left only a few sentinels to watch the fruits that were growing in the gardens . Robinson and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the margin of the sea , approaching it at last over a bank ofpebbles which lined the shore , and formed a sort of ridge of sand and shingle , six or eight feet higher than the level of the water . The slope of these pebbles , on the seaward side , was covered with saline incrustations . The water had a greenish hue , and its surface was very brilliant . To the taste , the travelers found it intensely and intolerably salt , and far more nauseous than the waters of the ocean . The great quantity of saline matter , which it contains , makes it very dense , and , of course , very buoyant in respect to bodies floating in it . This property of the sea has been observed and commented upon by visitors in every age . Swiminers , and those who can not swim , as an ancient writer expressed it , are borne up by it alike . Robinson himself bathed in the sea , and though , as he says , he had never learned to swim , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand , lie , or float in any position without difficulty . Thc bottom was of clean sand and gravel , and the bathers found that the water shoaled very gradually as they receded from the shore , so that they were obliged to wade out many rods before it reached their shoulders . Its great density produced a peculiar effect in respect to the appearance that it presented to the eye , adding greatly to its brilliancy , and imparting a certain pearly richness and beauty to its reflections . The objects seen through it on the bottom appeared as if seen through oil . MEAsUREMENTs . After having spent some time in noting these general phenomena , Robinson , finding that the day was wearing away , called the attention of his party to the less entertaining but more important work of making the necessary scientific measurements and observations . He laid off a base line on the shore , fifteen hundred feet in length ; and from the extremities of it , by means of a large and accurate compass , which he carried with him in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearings of all the principal points and headlands which ciould be seen around the sea , as well as of every mountain in view . By this means he secured the data for making an exact map of the sea , at least so far as these leading points are concerned ; for , by the application of certain principles of trigonometry , it is very easy to ascertain the precise situation of any object whatever , provided its precise bearing from each of two separate stations , and also the precise distance between the two stations is known . Accordingly , by establishing two stations on the plain , and measuring the distance between them , and then taking the bearings of all important points on the shores of the sea , from both stations , the materials are secured for a correct map . of it , in its general outline . This work being accomplished , and the day being now fully spent , the party bade the shores of the sea farewell ; and , weary with the fatigues and excitement of the day , they began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path toward their encampment by the fountain . They at length arrived at their tent , and spent the evening there to a late hour , in writing out their records of the observations which they had made , and of the adventures which they had met with during the day . From time to time , as the hours passed on , they looked out from their tent to survey the broad expanse of water now far below them . The day had been sultry and hot , but the evening was cool . The air was calm and still , and the moon rising behind the eastern mountains shone in upon their encampment , and cheered the solitude of the night , illuminating , at the same time , with her beams , the quiet and lonely surface of the sea . THE 5ALT MOUNTAIN OF U5DUM . At a subsequent period of his tour in the Holy Land , Robinson approached the Dead Sea again , near the southern extremity of it , and there examined and described a certain very remarkable geological formation , which is justly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley . It is called the Salt Mountain of Usdum . It is a lofty ridge that extends for a great distance along the shore of the sea , and consists of a solid mass of rock-salt . The situation of this mountain , as will be seen from the map , is on the southwestern shore of the sea . There is a narrow tract of low and level land between the mountain and the water . The road passes along this plain , close under the cliffs , giving the trdv* eler a very convenient opportunity of ex*ining the formation of the mountain as b ' journeys with his caravan slowly along . The existence of such a mor. *itain of salt was asserted by certain travelers many centuries ago , but the accounts which they gave of it were not generally believed , the spot being visited too seldom , and the accounts which were brought from it being too vague and imperfect to confirm sufficiently so extraordinary a story . Robinson , however , and other travelers who have , since his day , fully explored the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ridge is very uneven and rugged , its summit and its sides having been furrowed by the rains which sometimes , though at very distant intervals , fall in this arid region . The height of the ridge is from one hundred to one hundred and fifty feet . The surface of the hill is generally covered , like that of other rocky ridges , with earth and marl , and sometimes with calcareous strata of various kinds , so that its true character is in some meas // nre concealed from ordinary and casual observers . The mass of salt , however , which underlies these superficial coverings , breaks out in various places along the line of the hills , and sometimes forms perpendicular precipices of pure crystalized fossil salt , forty or fifty feet high , and several hundred feet long . The traveler who beholds these crystaline cliffs is always greatly astonished at the spectacle , and can scarcely believe that the mountain is really what it seems , until he has gone repeatedly to the precipice and broken off a fragment from the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rock , by tasting the specimen . The mountain extends for two or three miles along the shore , drawing nearer and nearer to it towai4 the south , until at last it approaches so closely to the margin of the sea , that the waters , when high , wash the foot of the precipice . Along the road which lies between the cliffs and the shore , and upon the beach , masses of salt are found , which , having been broken off from the heights above , have fallen down to the level land below , where they lie like common rocks upon the ground . Here and there ravines are found , forming little dells , down which small streams are constantly trickling ; and , in some seasons of the year rains fall , and , dissolving small portions of the rock , flow with the solution into the sea below . Of course , what salt finds its way into the sea remains there forever , except so far as it is carried away by man-for the process of evaporation takes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very small annual addition is therefore sufficient to keep up the saltness of such a sea . It is supposed that this mountain is the source Which furnishes the supply in this case . If so , the Dead Sea , geologically speaking , is simply an accumulation of the waters of the Jordan , formed in a deep depression of its valley , and made salt by impregnation from a range of soluble rocks , the base of which they lave . THE CAVERN . At one point in the eastern face of the Usdum mountain , that is the face which is turned toward the sea , there is a cavern . This cavern seems to have been formed by a spring . A spring of water issuing from among soluble strata will , of course , always produce a cavern , as its waters must necessarily dissolve and wear away the substance of the rock , and so , in the process of ages , form an open recess leading into the heart of the mountain . The few European travelers who have ever passed the road that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped to examine and explore this cavern . It is irregular in its form , but very considerable in extent . The mouth of it is ten or twelve feet high , and about the same in breadth . Robinson and his // party went into it with lights . They followed it for three or four hundred feet into the heart of the mountain , until at length they came to a place where it branched off into two small fissures , which could not be traced any farther . A small stream of water was trickling slowly along its bed in the floor of the cavern , which , as well as the walls and roof , were of solid salt . There were clear indications that the quantity of water flowing here varied greatly at different seasons ; and the cavern itself was undoubtedly formed by the action of the stream . AN INCIDENT OF ORIENTAL TRAVELING . When Robinson and his party came out from the cavern in the Salt Mountain , an incident occurred which illustrates so forcibly both the nature of Oriental traveling , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the shores of the Dead Sea , that it well deserves a place in this memoir . When they were about entering the cavern , a report came from some of the scouts , of whom it was always customary to have one or more ahead , when traveling on these expeditions , that a troop of riders were in sight , coming round the southern end of the sea . This report had been confirmed during the time that Robinson and his companions had been in the cave , and when they came out they found their camp in a state of great confusion and alarm . The strangers that were co*ping were supposed , from their numbers , and from the manner in which they were mounted , to be enemies or robbers . The Arab attendants of the party were greatly excited by this intelligence . They were getting their guns in readiness , and loading and priming them . A consultation was held , and it was determined by the party that they would not leave their encampment at the mouth of the cavern , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford them a considerable advantage , as they judged , in the case of an attack . They accordingly began to strengthen themselves where they were with such means as they had at their command , and to make the best disposition they could of the animals and baggage , with a view to defending them . At the same time they sent forward an Arab chieftain of the party , to reconnoitre and learn more particularly the character of the enemy . The messenger soon returned , bringing back a report which at once relieved their fears . The dreaded troop of marauders proved to be a flock of sheep , driven by a few men on donkeys . Of course , all alarm was at once dispelled , and the ei*pedition immediately resumed its march , pursuing its way as before along the strand . But this was not the end of the affair , for the Arabs of Robinson 's escort , finding that they were now the stronger party , at once assumed the character of robbers themselves , and began immediately to make preparations for plundering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood the subject , fully justified them in doing so , and before Robinson was aware of their intentions , they galloped forward , and attacked the peaceful company of strangers , and began to take away from them every thing valuable on which they coia.ld lay their hands . One seized a pistol , another a cloak , and a third stores of provisions . Robinson and his companions hastened to the spot and arrested this proceeding , though they had great difficulty in doing it . The Arabs insisted that these men were their enemies , and that they had a right to rob them wherever they found them . To which Robinson replied , that that might perhaps be the law of the desert , but that while the Arabs were in his employ they must be content to submit to his orders . At length the stolen property was reluctantly restored , and the strangers went on their way . They proved to be a party in the service of a merchant of Gaza , a town on the Mediterranean coast , nearly opposite this part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the village which has already been mentioned as seen by our party from their position on the heights of Am Jidy , at the head of the valley which opens on the eastern side of the sea beyond Zoar  --  and there he had purchased a flock of sheep , and was now driving them , with the assistance of some peasants whom he had hired for the purpose , home to Gaza . THE FORD . As has already been stated , the water of the Dead Sea , though deep in the northern part , spreads out toward the southward over an immense region of flats and shallows , so that sometimes the water is only a few feet deep over an extent of many miles . There are , moreover , southward of the sea , vast tracts of low and sandy land , which are sometimes covered with water and sometimes bare , on account of the rising and falling of the sea , the level of which seems to vary many feet in different years and in different seasons , according to the state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought down by the Jordan and other streams . The shallowness of the water becomes very marked and apparent at the peninsula , and various rnmors were brought to Europe , from time to time , in the middle ages , of a fording place there , by means of which caravans , when the water was low , could cross over from the eastern shore to the western , and thus save the long detour around the southern end of the sea . The most direct and tangible evidence in respect to this ford , was given by the two celebrated travelers , Irby and Mangles , who relate that in descending from Kerak to the peninsula , they fell in with a small company of Arabs that were going down to the sea-riding upon asses and other beasts of burden . The Arabs of this caravan said that they were going to cross the sea at the ford . The travelers did not actually see them make the passage , for they were themselves engaged in exploring the eastern and northern part of the peninsula at the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached the water , by the high land intervening between them and the travelers . After a short time , however , tli.e travelers came over to the western // side of the promontory , and there they saw the service , made his celebrated expedition into the place of the ford indicated by boughs of trees Holy Land , for the express purpose of exploring set up in the water . The caravan had passed the River Jordan and the ' *Dead Sea . We have the ford , and were just emerging from the water already , in our article oriLthe River Jordan , given on the western side of the sea Thii* *v*t1Pn** an account of the landing of this party at the Bay of Acre , of their extraordinary journey across the country to the Sea of Galilee , and of their passage down the Jordan in the metallic boats , the Fanny Mason and the Fanny Skinner , which they had brought with them across to the Mediterranean . We now propose to narrate briefly the adventures which the intrepid explorer met with in his cruise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , . it was considered both by himself and his companions , and also by his countrymen and friends at home , to be extremely doubtful whether he would be able to accomplish it . All previous attempts to navigate the sea had failed , and had 1 ) roved fatal to their projectors . Some had been destroyed by the natives-others had sunk under the pestiferous effects of the climate . When , therefore , the boats of tljis party , heavily laden with their stores of provisions and their crews , came from the mouth of the Jordan out into the open sea , the hearts was considered as very direct and very conclusive , and yet other travelers who visited the same region , both before and afterward , could obtain no certain information in respect to the ford . Allusions to it exist in some very ancient records , and yet the Arabs themselves who live in the vicinity , when inquired of in respect to the subject , often denied the possibility of such a passage . The only way , apparently , of reconciling these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is subject to great changes of level , and that for certain periods , perhaps at distant intervals from each other , the water is so low that caravans can cross it-and that afterward it becomes again too deeptobe passable , continuing so perhaps for a long series of years , so that the existence of the ford is for a time in some measure forgotten . LIEUTENANT LYNCH . The information which the Christian world obtained in respect to the Dead Sea and the character of the country around it , was , after all , down to quite a late period , of a very vague and unsatisfactory character , being derived almost entirely from the reports of occasional travelers who approached the shores of it , from time to time , at certain points more accessible than others , but who remained at their places of observation for so brief a period , and were so restricted in respect to their means and facilities for properly examining the localities that they visited , that , notwithstanding all their efforts , the geography and natural history of the region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the year 1847 , when Lieutenant Lynch , of the United States naval of the adventurous navigators were filled with many forebodings . A GALE . The party expected to spend several weeks upon the sea , and their plan was to establish fixed encampments from time to time on the shore , to be used as stations where they could keep the necessary stores and supplies , and from which they could make excursions over the whole surface of the sea . The first of these stations was to be at a place called the Fountain of Feshkah ; a point on the western shore of the sea , about five miles from the mouth of the Jordan . The caravan which had accompanied the expedition along the bank while they had been descending the river , were to go around by land , and meet the boats at the place of rendezvous at night . Things being thus arranged , the land and water parties took leave of each other , and the boats pushed out upon the sea-turning to the westward and southward as soon as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bank of the river  --  and shaped their course in a direction toward the place of rendezvous . Their course led them across a wide bay , which forms the northwestern termination of the sea . There was a fresh northwestern wind blowing at the time , though they did not anticipate any inconvenience from it when they left the river . The force of the wind , however , rapidly increased , and the effects which it produced were far more serious than would have // resulted from a similar gale in any other sea . The weight of the water was so great , on account of the extraordinary quantity of saline matter which it l1eld in solution , that the boats in encountering the waves , suffered the most tremendous concussions . The surface of the sea became one wide spread sheet of foaming brine , while the spray which dashed over upon the men , evaporating as it fell , covered their faces , their hands , and their clothes with encrustations of salt , producing , at the same time , prickling and painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes . The party , nevertheless , pushed boldly on for some time toward the west , in the hope of reaching the shore . The wind , however , being almost directly ahead , they made very little progress . They began to fear that they should be driven entirely out to the open sea , and at length , about the middle of the afternoon , when they had been for some hours in this dangerous situation , the gale increased to such a degree that the boats were in imminent danger of foundering . The officers were obliged to order their supplies of water to be thrown overboard , in order to lighten the burden . They gave up all hope of gaining the land ; and , expecting to spend the night on the sea , they thought only of the means of saving themselves from sinking . At length , however , about six o'clock , the wind suddenly ceased , and the waves , on account of the great weight of the water , almost immediately went down . The voyagers now , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaining the land . THE FIRST ENCAMPMENT . It was , however , now dark , and Mr. Lynch felt much solicitude in respect to the difficulty of finding the place of rendezvous on the coast where the party in the boats were to meet the caravan . They rowed along the shore to the southward , looking out on all the cliffs and headlands for lights or other signals . They had an Ar*.b chieftain on board as a guide , and on him the party had depended for direction to the place where the fountain of Feshkah was to be found . The Arab had , however , become so bewildered by the terror which the storm had inspired , or , perhaps , by the strange and unusual aspect which the land presented to him , as seen from the side toward the sea and in the night , that he seemed to be entirely lost . At length the boatmen saw the light of a fire on the beach to the southward of them . They discharged a gnn as a signal , and pulled eagerly toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The men were then at a loss again , and while resting upon their oars , awaiting another signal , they suddenly saw flashes , and heard reports of guns and sounds of voices on the cliffs , not far from them , and immediately afterward heard other reports from a considerable distance back , at a place which they had passed *in coming along the shore . These various and uncertain sounds quite embarrassed the boatmen . They might indicate an attack from some hostile force upon their friends on the land , or some stratagem , to draw the boats into an ambuscade . They , however , determined , at length , that they would , at all events , ascertain the truth ; so closing in with the shore , they pulled along the beach , sounding as they proceeded . About eight o'clock they arrived at the place of rendezvous , where they found their friends awaiting them at the fountain . The shouts and signal-guns which they had heard had proceeded from two portions of the caravan that had become separated on the march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The party in the boats were greatly relieved on reaching the land , for the whole scene through which they had passed in approaching it , had been one of the wildest and most exciting character . The sea itself , mysterious and unknown , the lonely and desolate coast , the dark and gloomy mountains , the human voices heard in shouts and outcries on the cliffs , with the flashes of the gnns , and the reports reverberating along the shore , joined to the dread uncertainty which the boatmen felt in respect to what the end of the adventure was to be , combined to impress the minds of all the party with the most sublime and solemn emotions . The boats , they found , for some reason or other , could not land at the place which had been chosen for the encampment , but were obliged to proceed about a mile to the southward , where , at length , they were safely drawn up upon the beach . Some Arabs were placed here to guard them , while the seamen were conducted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night of repose . The camp was pitched in a cane-brake , not far from the shore , the vegetation which covered the spot proving that there was nothing very specially deleterious in the atmosphere of the sea . In fact , during the remainder of the excursion , Mr. Lynch 's party always found , in landing along the shores , that there was always abundance of vegetation whenever there was fresh water from the mountains to sustain it . The water of the sea seems to be itself too deeply impregnated with saline solutions to nourish vegetable life ; but beyond the reach of the spray , which the wind drives only to a short distance from the margin of the shore , it exerts , apparently no perceptible influence on either plants or animals . Many animals were seen at different times in the vicinity of the sea , some on the land , and others flying freely over the water . The water itself , however , seemed to produce no living thing . Some few shells were found in two or three instances on the beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared under such circumstances as to lead to the supposition that they were brought down to the sea by the torrents from the mountains , or by the current of the Jordan . The scene which presented itself to the party as the night came on at this their first encampment on the shore of the Dead Sea , was solemn and sublime . The dark and gloomy mountains , barren and desolate-their declivities fretted and // furrowed by the tooth of time , rose behind them in dismal grandeur ; the waters of the sea lay reposing heavily in their vast caldron before them , covered with a leaden-colored mist ; while the moon , which rose toward midnight above the mountains beyond , cast spectre-like shadows from the clouds over the broad and solemn expanse , in a wild and fantastic manner . Every thing seemed strange and unnatural , and wore an expression of unspeakable loneliness and desolation . And yet about midnight the death-like silence and repose which reigned around , was strangely broken by the distant tolling of a bell ! The tolling of the bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mar Saba , a rude and lonely structure , situated in the middle of the desolate gorge which the brook Kedron forms in traversing the mountains that lie between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea . The place of the convent was seven or eight miles from the shore where our travelers were encamped , but yet the tones of the bell , calling the monks to their devotions , made their way to the spot through the still evening air . The travelers felt cheered and encouraged in their solitude , by being thus connected again , even by so slender a bond as this , with the common family of man , from which they had seemed before to have undergone an absolute and total separation . THE VOYAGE TO EN-GEnI . After remaining a day or two at Feshkah , and making various excursions across the sea and along the shores , from that station , for the purpose of measuring distances and taking soundings , the party broke up their encampment , and prepared to proceed to the southward . They made arrangements for taking every thing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one single camel , which was to be sent along the shore . Their intention was to proceed to Engedi , and to encamp there at the foot of the cliffs , on the little plain which Robinson had visited about ten years before . This encampment at En-gedi was to be a sort of permanent station for the party during all the time necessary for the survey of the middle and southern portions of the sea . It was a suitable spot for such a post , on account of its central position , and also on account of the abundant supply of fresh water which could be obtained there from the fountain . The company were obliged to hasten their departure from Feshkah ; for the water of the fountain at the place of their first encampment was brackish and unfit for use , while the supply which they had brought from the Jordan was nearly exhausted . Their stock of provisions , too , was well-nigh spent , and Lieutenant Lynch felt a considerable degree of uneasiness in respect to the means of sufficiently replenishing it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerusalem , to procure supplies , directing them to bring whatever they could procure to En-gedi . He also sent an Arab chieftain , named Akil , round to the eastern side of the sea , to Kerak , to purchase provisions there . The Arab , if successful , was to bring down his stores to the sea , at the peninsula , and at the proper time , Lieutenant Lynch was to send one of the bo4s across from Engedi to receive them . Things being thus arranged , the tents were struck , the boats pushed off from the land , while a train of Arabs attended by the loaded camel took up their line of march along the beach . As they proceeded , the boats stopped from time to time , to note and to record every thing worthy of notice that appeared along the shore . They passed the mouth of the brook Kcdron , a deep gorge , narrow at the base , and yawning wide at the summit . The sides of this frightful ravine were twelve hundred feet high . The bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream at this season of the year being wholly absorbed by the sands long before reaching the sea . They passed many caves , some opening into the face of the rock , far up the mountain sides , in positions wholly inaccessible . The shores were generally barren and desolate , consisting of dark brown mountains , which looked as if they had been scorched by fire , with a narrow beach equally dreary and desolate below . Here and there , however , little valleys opened , which sustained a scanty vegetation , and birds and other animals were occasionally seen . There seemed to be no vegetation , except at points where streams or springs of fresh water flowed down from the land . The boats proceeded onward in this manner till night , and then rounding a point which was covered sparsely with bushes and trees , and with tufts of cane and grass , they came into a little bay which opened to a dell , fertilized by a fountain . The name of the fountain was Turabeh . Flowers were growing here , and certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our voyagers , though in any other situation they would have attracted little attention . The stream which sustained this vegetation was extremely small . The water trickled down from the spring so scantily that the Arabs were forced to dig holes in the sand , and wait for them to fill , in order to procure enough for drink . Still its influence was sufficient to clothe its narrow dell with something like verdure and fruitfulness . The little oasis had its inhabitants , too , as well as its plants and flowers . One of the party saw a duck at a little distane** from the shore , and fired at her ; though it might have been thought that no one could have had the heart to disturb even a duck in the possession of so solitary and humble a domain . In fact , it seems the sportsman must have had some misgivings , and was accordingly not very careful in his aim , for the bird was not harmed by the shot . She flew out to sea a little way , alarmed by the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , began to swim back again toward the shore , as if thinking it not possible that the strange intruders into her lonely home , whoever and whatever they might be , could really intend to do her any harm . // Soon after the party in the boats had landed , the camel with his attendants arrived , and they all encamped on this spot for the night . The . cene which presented itself when the arrangements had been made for the night was , as usual in such cases , very solemn and impressive . The tents stood among the trees . The Arab watchtires were burning . The boats were drawn up upon the shore . The dark and sombre mountains rose like a wall behind the encampment ; while the smooth and placid sea was spread out before it , reflecting with a sort of metallic lustre the silver radiance of the moon . The stillness , too , which reigned around seemed strange and fearful , it was so absolute and profound . In the morning , the party , after breakfasting under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeding a few miles along the coast , they saw an Arab on the beach . The Arab hailed the party , and they attempted to communicate with him , but could not understand what he said . At one place they stopped to examine a mass of ruins which they saw standing a short distance up the mountain side . The ruins proved to be the remains of a Wtdl , built to defend the entrances to several caves which opened in the face of the precipice directly behind them . The caves were perfectly dry , and one of them was large enough to contain twenty or thirty men . There were openings cut from them through the rock to the air above , intended apparently to serve the purpose of chimneys . These caves were in the wilderness of En-gedi . In fact , the boats were now drawing near to their place of destination . At noon they arrived at the spot , and the party landing , unloaded the noats and hauled them up upon the shore . They selected a spot for their encampment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not far from the place where the stream descends to it from the mountain above . They found that the gardens and other mrtrks of vegetation which Robinson had observed at the time of his visit , had disappeared ; in other respects , every thing corresponded with his description . The water was gushing from the fountain as copiously as ever , and was disappearing as rapidly in the sands of its thirsty bed , after running its short and foaming course along its little dell . After a brief survey of the scene , the ground was marked out , the tents were pitched , and the stores deposited within them ; the boats were hauled up and examined for repairs , and all the arrangements made for a permanent encampment ; for this was to be the head-quarters of the expedition during all the remaining time that they were to spend upon the sea . They named it " Camp Washington . " EXPLORING 5 . The encampment thus established at En-gedi continued to be occupied as the head-quarters of our party for two or three weeks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for exploring the whole southern portion of the sea , and the country around . The engineer of the party measured a base line on the beach , and from the two stations at the extremities of it took the bearings of all the important points on the shores of the sea . He made the necessary astronomical observations also for determining the exact latitude and longitude of the camp . Parties were sent out , too , sometimes along the shores and up the mountains to collect plants and specimens , and at other times across to the eastern shore to measure the breadth of the sea , and to make soundings for determining the depth of it in every part . They preserved specimens and memorials of every thing . Even the mud and sand , and the cubical crystals of salt which their sounding apparatus brought up from the bottom of the sea , were put up in airtight vessels to be brought home for the inspection of naturalists and philosophers in America . Thus the whole party were constantly employed in the various labors incident to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange and romantic adventures , and suffering on many occasions most excessively from exposure and fatigue . One of the most remarkable of the expeditions which they made from their camp at En-gedi. was a cruise of four days in the southern portion of the sea , in the course of which they circumnavigated the whole southern shore . In following down the western coast in first commencing their voyage , they found the scenery much the same as it had been in the northern part of the sea , the coast being formed of bald and barren mountains , desolate and gloomy , with TURABEH. // a low , flat beach below , and sometimes a broad peninsula , or delta , formed , at the mouths of the ravines , by the detritus brought down from above . Farther south , however , the water became very shoal , so much so , that at last they could not approach the shore near enough to land , without wading for a great distance through water and mire . In fact , the line of demarkation between the land and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of low flats and slimy mud , coated with incrustations of salt , and sometimes with masses of drift-wood lying upon it , while the water was covered with a frothy scum , formed of salt and bitumen . Sometimes for miles the water was only one or two feet deep , and the men in such cases , leaving the boats , waded often to a great distance from them . Every night , of course , they stopped and encamped on the land . THE siaocco . The party suffered on some occasions most intensely from heat and thirst . Their supply of water was not abundant , and one of the principal sources of solicitude which the officers of the expedition felt throughout the cruise , was to find fountains where they could replenish their stores . One night they were reduced to the greatest extreme of misery from the influence of an intolerably hot and suffocating wind , which blew upon them from off the desert to the southward . It was the Sirocco . It gave them warning of its approach on the evening before by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain unnatural and lurid hue , that awakened a mysterious emotion of awe and terror . Something dreadful seemed to be portended by it . It might be a thunder-tempest ; it might be an earthquake , or it might be some strange and nameless convulsion of nature incident to the dreadful region to which they had penetrated , but elsewhere unknown . The whole party were impressed with a sentiment of solemnity and awe , and deeming it best for them to get to the land as soon as possible , they took in sail , turned their boats ' heads to the westward , and rowed toward the shore . In a short time they were struck suddenly by a hot and suffocating hurricane , which blew directly against them , and , for a time , not only stopped their progress , but threatened to drive them out again to sea . The thermometer rose immediately to 1050 . The oarsmen were obliged to shut their eyes to protect them from the fiery blast , and to pull , thus blinded , with all their strength to stem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable , of course , thus to protect themselves , and their eyelids became dreadfully inflamed by the hot wind before they reached the land . At length , to their great joy , they succeeded in getting to the shore . They landed at a most desolate and gloomy spot at the mouth of a dismal ravine ; and the men , drawing the boats up on the beach , immediately began to seek , in various ways , some means of escape from the dreadful influences of the blast . Several went up the ravine in search of some place of retreat , or shelter . Others finding the glare of the sun upon the rocks insupportable , while they remained on the shore , returned to the boats and crouched down under the awnings . One of the officers put spectacles upon his eyes to protect them from the lurid and burning light , but the metal of the bows became so hot , that he was obliged to remove them . Every thing metallic , in fact , such as the arms , and even the buttons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the touch , and the wind , instead of bringing the usual refreshing influences of a breeze , was now the vehicle of heat , and blew hot and suffocating along the beach , as if coming . from the mouth of an oven . Intolerable as the influence was of this ill-fated blast , it increased in power , until it blew a gale . The distant mountains , seen across the surface of the sea , were curtained by mists of a purple and deadly hue . The sky above was covered with bronze-colored clouds , through which the declining sun shone , red and rayless , diffusing over the whole face of nature , instead of light , a sort of lurid and awful gloom . The sun went down , and the shades of the evening came on , but the heat increased . The thermometer rose to 1060 . The wind was like the blast of a furnace . The men , without pitching their tents or making any other preparations for the night , threw themselves down upon the ground , panting and exhausted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continually to the " water breakers , " in which their supplies of water were kept , and drank inces* santly , but their thirst could not be assuaged . Things continued in this state till midnight . The wind then went down , and very soon afterward a gentle breeze sprung up from the northward . The thermometer fell to 820 , and the Sirocco was over . THE PILLAR OF SALT . Mr. Lynch 's party visited the salt mountain of Usdum , of which we have already spoken , and examined it throughout its whole extent , in a very careful and thorough manner . They found at one place , at the head of a deep and narrow chasm , a remarkable conformation of the salt rock , consisting of a tall cylindrical mass , standing out detached , as it were , from the mountain behind it , and appearing like an artificial column . It was in fact literally a pillar of salt . It was forty or fifty feet high , and was capped above with a layer of limestone , a portion perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote geological period had been deposited over the whole bed of salt . The appearance of the pillar was as if it were itself a portion of the salt mountain that had been left by the gradual disintegration and wearing away of the adjoining mass , having assumed and preserved its tall and columnar form , through the protecting influence of the cap of insoluble rock on its summit . The mass , though as seen in front it appeared to stand isolated and alone like a pillar , was connected with the precipice // behind it by a sort of buttress , by means of which some of the party climbed up to the top of the gigantic geological ruin , and standing upon the pinnacle , looked down upon their companions below , and upon the wide scene of desolation and death which was spread out before them . sxcuasios TO KERAK . As we have already mentioned , an Arab chieftain who accompanied the expedition , had been sent round to the eastern side of the sea to the town of Kerak , which was situated , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond Zoar , to negotiate with the natives and to procure provisions , and a dayhad been appointed for him to come down to the shore , at a certain point on the peninsula , where a boat was to be sent to meet him . When the time arrived for fulfilling this appointment , Lieutenant Lynch organized a party for the excursion , and embarked for the eastern shore . On approaching the land at the appointed place of rendezvous , they saw an Arab lurking in the bushes , apparently watching for them , and soon afterward several more appeared . At first the voyagers doubted whether these were the friends whom they had come to meet or whether they were enemies lying in wait to entrap them . On approaching nearer to the beach , however , they soon recognized Akil . He seemed greatly rejoiced to see them . He informed them that he had been kindly received at Kerak , and he brought down an invitation to Lieutenant Lynch , from the chieftain that ruled there , to come up to the valley and make him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept this invitation . He encamped , however , first on the shore for a day or two , to make the necessary explorations and surveys in the neighborhood . During this time he went out with two Arabs across the plain , to examine the supposed site of ancient Zoar . He found ruins of an ancient village there , and fragments of pottery , and other similar vestiges on the ground . At length , on the morning of the third day , leaving his boat in the care of a guard , he put himself and his party of attendants under Akil 's guidance , and set out to ascend the valley . The party were fourteen in number . The sailors were mounted on mules . The officers rode on horseback . The cavalcade was escorted by a troop oftwenty armed Arabs -- twelve mounted and the rest on foot . They found the valley which they had to ascend in going up to Kerak , a gloomy gorge , of the wildest and grandest character . The path was steep and very difficult , overhanging on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhung on the other with beetling crags , blackened as if by fire , and presenting an aspect of unutterable and frightful desolation . To complete the sublimity of the scene , a terrific tempest of thunder , lightning , and rain swept over the valley while our party were ascending it , and soon filled the bottom of the gorge with a roaring and foaming torrent , which came down from the mountains and swept on toward the sea with a thundering sound . At length the party reached the brow of the table land , three thousand feet above the level of the sea , and came out under the walls of the town . The town proved to be a dreary and comfortless collection of rude stone houses , without windows or chimneys , and blackened within with smoke . The inhabitants were squalid and miserable . Three-fourths of the people were nominally Christian . The visit of the Americans of course excited great interest . We have not time to detail the various adventures which the party met with in their intercourse with the inhabitants , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary scenes through which they passed . They remained one night at Kerak , and then after experiencing considerable difficulty in escaping the importunities with which they were besieged by the chieftains for presents , they succeeded in getting away and in returing safely to their boat on the shore . THE DEPRE55ION OF THE SEA . Our party , after having spent about three weeks in making these and similar excursions from their various encampments , during which time they had thoroughly explored the shores on every side , and sounded the depths of the water in every part , made all the necessary measurements and observations both mathematicaJ and meteorological , collected specimens for fully illustrating the geology and natural history sf the region , and carefully noted all the physical phenomena which they had observed , found that their work was done . At least all was done which could be accomplished at the sea itself One thing only remained to be determined , and that was the measure of the depressioa of the sea . This could be positively and precisely ascertained only by the process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , across from the sea to the shores of the Mediterranean . This work they now prepared to undertake , making arrangements at the same time for taking their final leave of the dismal lake which they had been so long exploring . It had been long supposed that the Dead Sea lay below the general level of the waters of the earth 's surface , and various modes had been adopted for ascertaining the amount of the depression . The first attempt was made by two English philosophers in 1837 . The method by which they attempted to measure the depression was by means of the boiling point of water . Water requires a greater or a less amount of heat to boil it according to the degree of pressure which it sustains upon its surface from the atmosphere-boiling with less heat on the tops of mountains where the air is rare , and requiring greater in the bottoms of mines , where the density and weight of the atmosphere is increased in proportion to the depth . Heights and depths , therefore , may be approximately measured by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the locality in question , when water begins to boil . By // qwq A short time after this experiment was performed a very careful observation was made by means ofabarometer , which also , measuring , asit does , the density of the air , directly , may be made use of to ascertain heights and depths . It is , in fact , often thus employed to measure the heights of mountains . The result of observations with the barometex gave a depression to the surface of the sea of about six hundred feet . A third method is by trigonometrical calculation . This mode is much more laborious and difficult than either of the other modes which we have alluded to , but it is more to be relied upon in its results . The data for a trigonometrical calculation are to be obtained by observing , qwq Galilee to commence his dangerous voyage , to ( liscourage him from the undertaking , was that of the unfortunate Costigan . Costigan was an Irish gentleman who , some years before the period of Lieutenant Lynch 's expedition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea , in a boat , with a single companion  --  a sailor whom he employed to accomj*any him , to row the boat , and to perform such other services as might be required . Costigan laid in a store of provisions and water , sufficient , as he judged , for the time that would be consumed in the excursion , and then taking his departure from a point on the shore near the mouth of the Jordan , he pushed out with his single oarsman over the waters of the sea . About eight days afterward , an Arab woman , wandering along the shore near the place where these voyagers had embarked , found Costigan ying upon the ground there , in a dying condition , *done , and the boat at a little distance on the beach , stranded and abandoned . The woman took pity upon the sufferer , and calling some Arab men to the spot , she persuaded them to take him up , and carry him to Jericho . There they found the sailor , who , better able as it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had strength enough left , when the boat reached the land , to walk , and had , accordingly , made his way to Jericho , leaving his master on the shore while he went for succor . At Jericho Costigan revived a little , and was then taken to Jerusalem , where he was lodged in a convent , and every effort was made to save his life and to promote his recovery , but in vain . He died in two days , and was never able to give any account of the events of his voyage . The sailor , however , when questioned in re spect to the events of the cruise , gave an account of such of them as a mere sailor would be likely to remember . They moved , he said , in a zigzag direction on the lake , crossing and recrossing it a number of times . They sounded every day , and found the depth of the water in many places very great . The sufferings , the sailor said , which they both endured from the heat , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausting . In three days , however , they succeeded in reaching the southern extremity of the sea , and then set out on their return . During all this time Costigan himself took his turn regularly at the oars , but on the sixth day the supply of water gave out , and then Costigan 's strength entirely failed . On the seventh day , they had nothing to drink but the water of the sea . This only aggravated instead of relieving their thirst , and on the eighth day the sailor underto.ok to make coffee from the sea water , hoping , by this means , to disguise in some measure its nauseating and intolerable saltness . But all was in vain . No sustenance or strength could be obtained from such sources , and the sailor himself soon found his strength , too , entirely gone . All attempts at rowing were now , of course , entirely abandoned , and although the boat had nearly reached the land again , at the mouth of the Jordan , the ill fated navigators must have perished floating on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprung up just at this junctureblowing toward the land . The sailor , though too much exhausted to row , contrived to raise the sail , and to guide the helm , so that the boat at length attained the shore . There be left his master . while he himself made his way to Jericho , as has been a ! ready described . 1'hese and several other attempts somewhat similar in their nature and results , which had been made in previous years , made it evident to Lieutenant Lynch , when he embarked in his enterprise , that he was about to engage in a very dangerous undertaking . The arrangements and plans which he formed , however , were on a much greater scale and far more complete than those of any of his predecessors , and he was enabled to make a much more ample provision than they for all the various emergencies which might occur in the course of the expedition . By these means , and through the extraordinary courage , energy , and resolution displayed by himself and by the men under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result . THE FUTLTRE . The true character and condition of the whole cOsTIGAN. // valley of the Dead Sea having been thus fully ascertained , and all the secrets of its gloomiest recesses having been brought fully to light , it will probably now be left for centuries to come , to rest undisturbed in the dismal and death-like solitude which seems to be its peculiar and appropriate destiny . Curious travelers may , from time to time , look out over its waters from the mouth of the Jordan , or survey its broad expanse from the heights at En-gedi , or perhaps cruise along under the salt cliffs of Usdum , on its southeastern shore , in journeying to or from the Arabian deserts ; but it will be long , probably , before any keel shall again indent its salt-encrusted sands , or disturb the repose of its ponderous waters . It is trne that the emotion of awe which its gloomy and desolate scenery inspires has something in it of the sublime ; and the religious associations connected with the past history of the sea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the spot a very attractive one to those who travel into distant climes from love of excitement and emotion . But the physical difficulties , dangers , exposures , and sufferings , which are unavoidably to be incurred in every attempt to explore a locality like this , are so formidable , and the hazard to life is so great , while the causes from which these evils , ind dangers flow lie so utterly beyond all possible or conceivable means of counteraction , that the vast pit will probably remain forever a memorial of the wrath and curse of God , and a scene of unrelieved and gloomy desolation .
