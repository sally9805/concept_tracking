ART . V.-EVERETT 'S ORATIONS AND SPEECHES . Orations and Speeches on various occasions . By EDWARD EVERETT . Second edition . Boston : Charles C. Little and James Brown . THERE is something in the character of this work , apart from its peculiar merits , that seems to us to have an auspicious bearing on our American literature . We refer to the fact that it is the gatheriug up in an attractive and enduring form , of the occasional efforts of a great mind , which would otherwise scarcely survive the day in which they were put forth ; for pamphlets are so essentially fugitive , that however heavy laden they may be with gems of thought or feeling or expression , we hardly think of looking for them , after a short season , unless it be among the rubbish of the garret or the treasures of the antiquary . If there has been a period in the history of our country , which has been more signalized for the vigorons workings of the human intellect on great and exciting topics , than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last century . The press had not indeed then its present efficiency ; and it had enough to do to chronicle the great events that were occurring , without giving forth the great speeches and orations and discourses of various kinds , with which those events were connected ; but unhappily , even the few which were published at the time , though they accomplished a glorious work in their day , have now nearly all passed into oblivion . The same remark holds true in respect to some of the finest efforts of the pulpit : the enthusiasm with which they were received , lasted long enough to secure their publication , but not long enough to protect them permanently from the depredations of the worm . Mayhew and Chauncey and the yotmger Cooper , who , though not all of them the most orthodox , were certainly among the most influential of the clergy of *ew England , published many sermons commemorative of great events in their time , and displaying intellectual powers of the highest order , the very titles of which are now almost universally forgotten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large number of discourses of a similar character , which are well worthy of perpetual preservation ; but , although little more than a single instrum has passed since his death , few of the present generation , have any knowledge of the greater part of these discourses , notwithstanding some of them are decidedly among the most eloquent of the author 's productions . Now we look upon it as among the propitious signs of the times , that there is an increasing disposition to save what is really // worth saving , for posterity , and even to stop many valuable things in their course down the stream of time , which seemed rapidly tending towards the gulf of oblivion . Within the last few years , the fugitive productions of several highly gifted minds , whose names form part of the history of our country , have been brought together ( in some instances as the fruit of much antiquarian research , ) and embodied in a form which renders them universally accessible , while it secures to them a permanent existence . Very much more of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not but think that those whose thoughts and efforts are turned in this direction , accomplish the triple end of rendering due honour to the past , and of performing good service for the present and the future . We are hap*y to observe , however , what we consider a yet more excellent way , and which , if ad-opted to the extent that is desirable , xvould supersede the necessity of all efforts to recover the lost treasure of other days ; - we refer to that of which we have a noble specimen in these volumes of Mr. Everett  --  the collecting and publishing of occasional discourses of various kinds , and delivered at different periods , with the consent and under the supervision of the author . This is far better than to leave the work to be done by others ; as it secures to the author the opportunity of selecting and rejecting what he l ) leaSes , and to the reader the benefit of the author 's careful and mature revision . A large part of the orations and speeches that compose these volumes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form , as they have been issued in successive years , during the last quarter of a century . So strong was the impression we received from the perusal of most of them , that we might perhaps have safely enough trusted to our recollections for the materials requisite to the present notice ; but that we might . have the greater chance of doing some justice to the work , we have chosen to go over anew with what was already somewhat familiar to us , especially as , in doing so , we were treating ourselves to the hivhest intellectual luxury . We do not propose to attempt any thing like a regular critique upon these volumes , but merely to state some of the most obvious reflections that have occurred to us in reading them , and T ) erhaps to add a few quotations in justification of what we shall say of their extraordinary attractions . If this work were to fall into the hands of an intelligent foreigner so ignorant of this country as not to have heard of Mr. Everett , ( if the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion to look beyond the table of contents to arrive at the conclusion that the author must be a remarkable man ; for we exceedingly doubt whether there is any other man of the age ,  - -  certainly there is no one on this side of the water ,  --  w hose labours have been put in requisition on such a variety of great occasions . // One can scarcely imagine a subject , intellectual or moral , sacred or secular , on which he has not been called to speak ; and most of the large towns in New England and many out of it have been honoured to be the theatre of his public efforts . Leaving out of view , therefore , the character of these discourses , as they are embodied in the present work , we have no hesitation in saying that the occasions which produced them must confer lasting honour upon their author , and that 1 ) 0 one who should look over the list of subjects here treated , would require any other evidence that he was about to be brought in contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazard nothing in saying that no expectation would be excited by an examination of the table of contents , that would not be fully met by an examination of the contents themselves . The first thing that strikes us is the extent and variety of the author 's knowledge . As he has written on almost every subject that can be imagined , so he seems equally at home upon all and he always wotes with such freedom and fullness , that one would suppose that the particular subject which he is treating , must have constituted the favorite study of his life . No matter whether it is history or politics , or education , or morals , or science , or agriculture , or commerce , or manufactures , or railroads , or any thing else within the range of human contemplation , to which his attention is directed , he seems to bring out with the utmost facility all the most important facts and speculations in relation to it , and not unfrequently opens up some new field , which perhaps he has been the first to explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was in college he was not only first in his class on the whole , but first in every thing ; and we rather think that this fact furnished a pretty correct index to the history of his life . But it is not merely the exuberance and variety of his information as exhibited in these volumes , that we so much admire , but the extremely unpretending mariner in which it is put forth , and the excellent practical account to which it is turned . Where a writer or speaker is called upon to go out of his ordinary track , and discourse upon matters that are not familiar to his thoughts , we gene rally feel at least the result of an extraordinary effort arid sometimes we find it is too easy to follow him in his illustratious , through other authors , and recognize material which he has borrowed fi'orn them , and incorporated with his own thoughts , without even subjecting it to the process of assimilation . At best he betrays the fact that he is not within his appropriate sphere ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need the apology which this fact suggests . But no one was ever farther from this than Mr. Everett . We never find bin ) saying anything , however extraordinary , with an air of self complacence , // or even with an apparent consciousness that he is rising above the level of ordinary minds . Whether he is dispensing from the treasures of his scientific knowledge , or whether he is tittering words of lofty import concerning the state , in high places , every thing is done with the graceful sii'nplicity of nature ; he seems to speak or write the thing that comes first to his thoughts ; and we recognize in what he produces rather the easy working of a highly gifted and accomplished mind , than any thing like special elaboration . The high practical tone of these writings also , as e have intimated , forms another of their attractions . There are writers of the present day of no mean intellectual standing , who accomplish nothing and aspire to nothing beyond mere airy speculations ; with whom the matter of utility is of little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather say a novel thing that is untrue than a true and useful thing that hears no stamp of novelty . When we speak of Mr. Everett 's writings a eminently practical , we do not mean that they are lacking in the due development of principles , or that they do not teach men how to think as well as how to act ; for they always contain enough of philosophy to meet the demands of the subject and the occasion , thotigh they show clearly that they emanate from a mind that has kept hack much more of philosophy than it has dispensed ; but we mean that the writer has always some end in view beyond mere momentary gratification ; that he is always looking diligently at the well being of the race ; and that , however much his performance may be admired , it Ks failed of its intended effect unless it has done something in aid of the great interests of society . As there is a word in season here for all classes , so there is that by which men of all classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen , the merchant , the mechanic and the farmer , men of every profession and every occupation , may find in these volumes that which will either constitute an addition to their knowledge , or give a new impulse to their efforts . There is also a rich vein of moral feeling running through these volumes , which can not be too highly commended . Unhappily , our English and even American , liter ture furnishes too many examples of the perversion of high intellectual endowments to purposes of moral depravation ; the man of genius has too often been found to be an infidel or a profligate ; nd when his productions have come to be analyzed , there have been detected the secret germs of false and corrupting thought , which he had intended should develope themselves unsuspected , amidst the bewildering glare of his splendid conceptions . And the cases are still more frequent in which there is observed a rigid neutrality in respect to every thing bearing upon human duty : there is no // positive infusion adverse to the interests of virtue ,  --  - nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but yet there is such a careful exclusion of every thing of an opposite character , that the effect can hardly fail to be injurious ; not merely because such a silence is alway accounted significant of indifference , if not of unbelief ; but because the absence of a positively good influence upon the mind alxvays leaves it at least defenceless against contamination . Mr. Everett has , in the uniform tone of these orations and speeches , administered an exem* plary rebuke to both these classes of authors . He always moves not only on the high ground of honour , but on the yet higher ground of a pure , evangelical morality . There is not a sentence in either of these volumes in respect to the moral influence of which any Christian parent would wish to put a child upon his guard ; while there is a spirit diffused through the whole , that every one feels must have been imbibed from the New Testament , and is fitted to minister to the growth of whatsoever is pure , lovely and of good report , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which he treats , he rarely , if ever , dismisses it , without having left the decided stamp of high moral feeling ; and there are not a few of these addresses that were called forth by the great moral or charitable or religions enterprizes of the day . rpemperamice , prison discipline , the famine in Ireland , the claims of various charitable institutions , and above all the Bible , have furnished themes for his eloquent amid stirring appeals . The last mentioned effort particularly ,  --  his address before the Massachusetts Bible society ,  --  not only breathes the purest moral sentiment , but is one of the most fitting and beautiful tributes to our common Christianity that we remember to have met with . We would venture to suggest whether it might not be an importarit service rendered to the cause of religious truth , to send forth this address in the form of a tract , especially among the higher classes ; for unless we greatly mistake , its eloquent and persua* sive tone in connection with its sound arid enlightened views , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astray , or to establish one who was doubtful , than many of the more formal and elaborate vindications of Christianity which seem to have become the accredited amid standard antidotes to skepticism . We like these works of Mr. Everett for another reason : they breathe throughout the spirit of reform , and yet they are essentially conservative . We live in a day when men can not be con* tented with the past or even the present , but are incessantly reaching forward to some hitherto nuattained advantage . Progress , progress , is emphatically the law of the age ; and it were as vain to think of stopping the onward march of things in the intellectual and moral world , as it would be to change the ordinance of Heaven in respect to the revolutions of the planets . So // far is well . God evidently did not intend that things should always remain stationary ; and men are only co-operating with God for the accomplishment of his purposes , when they labour earnestly in the cause of human improvement . But neither , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention that men in their haste to witness results , should turn scornfully or carelessly away from the appropriate means of bringing them about ; and should thus actually mock the divine wisdom in the honour which they render to their own . Now , unfortunately , the spirit of activity which is so extensively abroad , is too often erratic , sometimes even fierce and bitter ; and sober men are constrained to feel that many who claim to be the most earnest and efficient reformers , are actually the most legitimate subjects for reformation . And more than this-it can not be doubted that one extreme often begets the other ; that some men who are disinclined to effort , justify themselves in doing nothing by ringing perpetual changes on the extravagances of the day , while others who are well enough disposed , still keep aloof from various good enterprizes from a reluctance to be found in bad company . Mr. Everett has shown himself superior to all these mistakes . He is a thorough going , whole sonled reformer , in the best sense of that word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of reason or maxims of prudence . He is ready with a helping hand , whenever his services are demanded for any object that looks towards the melioration of society ; but he is never the abettor , but always the opposer , of any thing like fanatical excitement . He brings to every good work which he espouses a calm , dignified , yet earnest spirit , which is fitted at once to disarm or soften hostility , to check the workings of intemperate zeal , and to secure ultimately the happiest result . It may seem almost superfluous to speak of these productions as models of graceful and eloquent composition . They are marked by a simplicity that seems like the breathings of childhood ; by a perspicuity that might challenge the most stupid reader to mistake their meaning ; by a dignified elegance that bespeaks the most cultivated taste ; and to crown all , by a vigour and often an originality of thought , that forms the staple of all fine writing . Here again we may say that they are well fitted to act as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our literature ; - particularly to that silly affectation that has become so common , of saying trite or unuleaning things with an air of oracular assurance , or of conjuring tip a dense mist to hide the nakedness of the land . Some really gifted minds on both sides of the water have exerted a powerful influence in corrupting the public taste by interlarding their productions with all manner of quaint phrases , so that we have seemed to realize the resurrection of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries . Not a // few of our young men , we are sorry to see , have fallen into this literary snare ; and instead of being satisfied to convey their thoughts in a simple , natural and graceful manner , they have followed these *vandering stars into the regions of perpetual mist . Even the pulpit itself , unless we greatly mistake , has not altogether escaped this evil ; for we have now and then listened to a sermon so splendidly unintelligible , that though there was a world of admiration lavished upon it , no one wished to be interrogated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend to all preachers and writers who are ambitious of this ignoble distinction , to throw away their favorite authors , and take up these volumes of Mr. Everett as a regular study , with a view to bring themselves back to truth and nature . This is a kind of writing that will always endure , because it is conformed to the principles of a correct taste ; whereas the other will live through its little hour , and then be remembered only as the monument of a miserable affectation . It must be acknowledged that Mr. Everett 's taste in writing has undergone some change during the lapse of twenty five years . lie himself recognizes this fact in his preface ; and passes a severer judgment on his earlier productions , we think , than would he sustained by any impartial critic . That his literary efforts have been growing more simple as well as more classical , we do not doubt ; nevertheless we must be permitted to say , hi own judgment to the contrary notxvithstanding , that we have seen nothing from his pen that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phi Beta Kappa Oration , delivered at Cambridge on occasion of the metnorable visit of Lafayette in eighteen hundred and twenty-four . There is tnoreover an admirable fitness displayed throughout these productions  --  the orator always catches the spirit of the occasion ; and while he seems to know every thing that pertains to it , he brings out only that which is most important and most impressive . We never feel that he is treading upon dubious ground ; that he is uttering a sentiment which delicacy would have required him to suppress ; or that he has passed over something that would have rendered his performance more complete as well as more symmetrical on the contrary , the impression is irresistible that he has done full justice to his subject , as well in what he has omitted to say as in xvhat he has said ; atid though we may feel that the subject admitted of amplification , we can hardly imagine how it could have been treated more skilfully or more effectively within the same limits . Mr. Everett , quite unnecessarily , as xve think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same thoughts , in different parts of these volumes . Several of the orations are so nearly upon the same subject , that it would have // been impossible to avoid all repetition in consistency with doing justice to the occasion ; but it is , after all , so inconsiderable as not in the least to diminish the general interest ; and even where it occurs , the reader is constrained to feel that it results from the fitness of the case , and not from any circumscribed view of the subject . Besides , Mr. Everett has the faculty of repeating a thing in substance , so that it is scarcely recognized as repetition of introducing it in such new combinations and throwing around it so much rhetorical beauty , that the reader forgets that the same thought or the same fact had been before him in another form . The only remark that we will add as illustrative of our impressions in readiug these works , is that they form indirectly an important contribution to the history of the country . Not a small part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our national well being , but with our national existence . The Plymouth oration , for instance , is a choice piece of history covering the period to which it relates : it presents to us in a series of events of which the world has seen no parallel , the germ of all our greatness . The various orations delivered on the Fourth of July , and those on other special occasions looking back to the revolution , are full not only of the general but of the local history of that day ; and we doubt whether the bloody scenes of Lexington and Concord and Charlestown , are delineated any where else with more historic fidelity or more graphic power . Then there is much that is historical in the list of occasions which called forth these various efforts . A large part of them are new- to the present age , and may be regarded as indexes to the general progress of society . Most of these addresses could never have been written until within the last quarter of a century , because either the events which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had not been recognized as matter for public celebration . it is striking to notice how almost every irnportant change in society that has taken place during Mr. Everett 's public life , is here chronicled , and rno*t of them in the form of an occasion for a public effort . In this way , he has , beyond any other man , linked himself in with the history of his time , while yet , he has never set himself , in form , to do the work of an historian . He has , however , performed a much more important part than that of a mere chronicler of events ; he has held up the events in their high practical bearings , and has exhibited not more of the enlightened philosopher than of the earnest patriot , in the use that he has made of them . We recommend these works , therefore , not merely as a faithful record of many of the changes of society and the causes of these changes , but as being thoroughly imbued with the patriotic spirit , and well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jealousies which seem multiplying among us in such portentous profusion . // We intimated our intention , at the commencement of this article , to illustrate our opinion of these orations and speeches by some appropriate extracts . But in looking through the volumes , we find ourselves embarrassed , to a degree which we did not anticipate , in making the selection . The truth is , they are of such uniform excellence , that we should be in little danger of doing the author injustice , if we were to open at random and copy from any page on which our eye might chance to rest . Some writers give us occasionally a gem ,  --  apparently the effect of an uncommon gathering up of the faculties ,  --  xvhile , in the main , they are only tolerably interesting ; and we are sustained in our passage through many indifferent and barren pages , by the reflection that by and by there will come a green spot , where we can repose with delight . It is otherwise with Mr. Everett : we read his productions with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of being rendered prominent by being few and far between , sneceed each other with so much rapidity , that one rather feels that he is constantly breathing a pure atmosphere , and gazing on a beautiful sky , than only coming occasionally in contact with some invigorating or elevating influence . We shall confine ourselves to three brief extracts , being the close of three different addresses that were pronounced at periods about equidistant from each other . The first is from the address delivered before the Phi Beta Kappa Society of Harvard College ; and it is the first in point of time , as well as the first in the order of publication in these volumes . The occasion , always one of great interest , as bringing together a larger amount of the intelligence and literary refinement of the country than almost any other , was at this time invested with peculiar attractions , from being honoured with the presence of General Lafayette . We can not imagine that this grateful circumstance could have been more beautifully and impressively noticed than in the last of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the audience is still remembered by many , as forming one of the most splendid illustrations of the power of eloquence . " Here , then , a mighty work is to be performed , or never , by mortals . The man , who looks with tenderness on the sufferings of good men in other times ; the descendant of the Pit tins , who cherishes the memo ; y of his fathers ; the patriot , who feels an honest glow at the majesty of the system of which he is a member ; the scholar , who beholds , with rapture , the ion - sealed hook of truth opened for all to read without prejudice ; - thcse are they , by whom these aitspices are to be accomplished . Yes , brethren , it is by the intellect of the country that the mighty mass is to be inspired ; that its parts are to communicate and sympathize with each other ; its natural progress to be adorned with becoming refinements ; its principles asserted and its feelings interpreted to its own children , to other regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years are rapidly passing away , and gathering importance in their course . With the present year ( 1824 ) will be completed the halfcentury // from that most important era in human history  --  the commencement of our revolutionary war . The jubilee of our national existence is at hand . The space of time that has elapsed since that momentous date has laid down in the dust , which the blood of many of them had already hallowed , most of the great men to whom , under Providence , we owe our national existence and privileges . A few still survive among us , to reap the rich fruits of their labors and sufferings ; and ONE has yielded himself to the united voice of a people , and returned in his age to receive the gratitude of the nation to whom he devoted his youth . It is recorded on the pages of American history , that when this friend of our country applied to our commissioners at Paris , in 1776 , for a passage in the first ship they should dispatch to America , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abject was then our dear native land , ) that they possessed not the means , nor the credit , sufficient for providing a sin*ie vessel , in all the ports of France . Then , ' exclaimed the youthful hero , I will provide my own . ' And it is a literal fact that , when all America was too poor to offer him so much as a passage to her shores , he left , in his tender youth , the bosom of home , of domestic happiness , of wealth , of rank , to plunge in the dust and blood of our inauspicious struggle ! " Welcome , friend of our fathers , to our shores ! Ilappy are our eyes , that behold those venerable features ! Enjoy a triumph such as never conqueror nor monarch enjoyed  --  the assurance that , throughout America , there is not a bosom which does not beat with joy and gratitude at the sound of your name ! You have already met and saluted , or will soon meet , the few that remain of the ardent patriots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were associated in achieving our liberty . But you have looked round in vain for the faces of many , who would have lived years of pleasure , on a day like this , with their old companion in arms and brother in peril . Lincoln , and Greene , and Knox , and Hamilton , are gone ; the heroes of Saratoga and Yorktown have fallen before the enemy that conquers all . Above all , the first of heroes and of men , the friend of your youth , the more than friend of his country , rests in the bosom of the soil he redeemed . On the banks of his Potomac he lies in glory and in peace . You will re-visit the hospitable shades of Mount Vernon , but him , whom you venerated as we did , you will not meet at its door . His voice of consolation , which reached you in the dungeons of Olmiitz , can not now break its silence to bid you welcome to his own roof . But the grateful children of America will bid you welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shores ! And whithersoever your course shall take you , throughout the limits of the continent , the ear that hears you shall bless you , the eye that sees you shall give witness to you , and every tongue exclaim with heart felt joy , Welcome , welcome , La Fayette ! " Otir second extract shall be from * speech delivered by Mr. Everett in 1838 , at a festival celebrated at Exeter , in honour of the venerable Dr. Abbot , who , on that day resigned the place of Principal of Phillip 's Exeter Academy , which he had filled for fifty years . Mr. Everett had been , for a while , a pupil of Dr. Abbot , in fitting for college ; and it seemed alike filial and beatitiful that he should go up with all his honours , to bear testimony to the high qualities of his revered teacher , and welcome him , after such a life of useful service , to the dignity of retirement . The following passage shows how entirely he catight the spirit of the occasion " Lastly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association which invites us all , however otherwise disconnected , in one kind feeling ; as we meet together for the first and the last time in life , many of us to take a last // farewell of our revered preceptor ,  --  it has seemed meet that we should break the noontide bread together , and invite him also to meet us at the social board , there to pass the last hour that we shall ever all pass together on earth , in the interch uge of kind feelim with each other and with him . There , Sir , whether we pledge his health in the rosy or the limpid cup , the dews of Castalia I am sure will sweeten its brim , and the balm of ood-felowship give a flavor to the drau*ht . The occasion will there also he taken of offering to our respected teacher a slight hut permanent token of respect , of a domestic character , which will preserve at the fireside of his family , in aftertimes , the recollection of this day 's transactions . " Here , Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon my mind , which I find it equally difficult to suppress and to utter . I have read of an individual who was released from the Bastile after a confinement of more than thirty years . He sought for his family and the friends of his youth , and they were gone . The house in which he had lived had passed into the possession of strangers , and he desired to go back to the prison in which he had so long been immured . I can catch a glimpse of his feelings , as I wander about these scenes , familiar to me in hoyhood , and which I have but once or twice re-visited , and thet long ago , in the interval of more than thirty years since I was a pupil at the Academy . It was my good fortune to pass here hut a portion of the year before I entered college ; hut I can truly say that even in that short time I contracted a debt of gratitude , which I have felt throughout my life . I return to these endeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwelling-places are no more on the same spots ; old edifices have disappeared ; new ones , both public and private , have been erected . Some of the respected heads of society whom I knew , though as a child , are gone . The seats in the Academy-room are otherwise arranged than formerly , and even there the places that once knew me know roe no more . Where the objects themselves are unaltered , the changed eye and the ch ' noed mind see them differently . The streets seem narrower and shorter , the distances less considerable ; this play-ground before us , which I remember as most spacious , seems sadly contracted . But all , Sir , is not changed , either in appearance or reality . The countenance of our revered preceptor has undergone no change to my eye . It still expresses that sueviler in modo mentioned by the gentleman last up , ( Rev. Professor Ware , Jun. , ) with nothing of the sternness of the other principle . It is thus I remember it ; it was always sunshine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape , is unchanged ; the river still flows ; the woods yield their shade as pleasantly as they did thirty years ago , doubly grateful for the contrast they afford to the dusty walks of active life ; for the solace they yield in an escape , however brief , from its burdens and cares . As I stood in the hall of the AQademy , last evening , and saw from its windows the river winding through the valley , and the gentle slope rising from its opposite hank , and caught the cool breeze that was scattering freshness after the sultry summer 's day , I could/eel the poetry of Gray , on revisiting , in a like manner , the scenes of his school-boy daysAh , happy hills ! ah , pleasing shade !

" ' The remaining extract is from the address before the Massachusetts Bible society already referred to . Not only the address // itself , but the example which was set in delivering it , is well worthy of being contemplated by men in high places . The efforts of clergymen on such occasions lose no small part of the influence to which they are entitled , by being regarded as official ; but when a distinguished layman steps forward , as Mr. Everett has here done , in defence of the Bible , all suspicion of self interest , in any form , ceases ; and many a mind which would , at best , have opened reluctantly to the teachings of the pulpit or the voice of a clergyman , now finds itself in an unsuspecting , docile and attentive attitude . We do not wish to see laymen doing the appropriate and peculiar work of clergymen ; but there is some ground on which intelligent laymen may render most important service to the cause of truth and righteousnes , and still keep within their own sphere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address , shown himself a fine example . " There is another consideration of a practical nature , which I should be glad to offer to the meeting , if I have not exceeded my allowance of time . We all have pretty strong , and as I think , just impressions of the superiority of Christendom over the Mahometan , Ilindoo and Pagan countries . Our civilization , I know , is still very imperfect , impaired by many a vice which disgrace our Christian nurture ,  --  by many a woe which Appears a spot upon a vestal 's robe , The worse for what it soils . ' But when we compare the condition of things in Christendom with that which prevails in the countries just named , we find that all the evils which exist among us prevail there in a reater do roe , while they are suhject to innumerable others , so dreadful as to make us almost ready to think it were hotter for the mass of population , humanly speaking , if they had never heen horn . Well , now , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of no final and sufficient cause hut the different character of Christianity , and the religions which prevail in Turkey , Persia , India , China and the other semi-civilized or barbarons countries ; and this difference , as far as I know , is accurately reflected in their sacred books respectively . I mean , Sir , that the Bible stands to the Koran and tbe Vedas in the same relation as that in which Christianity stands to Mahometanism , or Brahmanism , or Buddhism ; or Christendom to Turkey , Hindoostan , or China . if " We should all , I believe , more fully appreciate the value of the Scriptures , we compared them with other books assuming the character of sacred . I have not done it so much as I wish I had ; but one reason  --  a main one-has been , the extreme repulsiveness of those books which I have tried to read . I have several times in my life attenipted to read the Koran . I have done so lately . I have approached it with a highly excited literary cniiosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great mystery of the Ar , bian desert . As I have , in some quiet Turkish town , ( for in the provincial Turkish towns there is little of the bustle of our western life , ) listened at the close of day to the clear , calm voice of the muezzin , from the top of the graceful minaret , calling the faithful to evening prayer ,  --  as I have mused on the vicissitudes of all human things beneath the venerable dome of St. Sophia 's ,  --  I have , I may say , longed to find some rational ground of sympathy between Christianity and Islam ; but any tIming more repulsive and uninviting than the Koran I have seldom attempted to peruse , even when taken up with these kindly feelings . And yet , Sir , you are well aware that it is not conceived in a spirit of hostility to the Old and New Testament , but recognizes them both as a divine revela // tion . With such portions of the sacred hooks of the Hindoos as have fallen in my way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true , some elevated moral sentiments of an ascetic cast , and some strains inspired by a sense of the beauties of nature . But the mythological system contained in them is a tissue of monstrosities and absurdities , by turns so revolting and nauseous as to defy perusal , except from some strong motive of duty or of literary curiosity , which would prompt the investigation . I really believe that few things would do more to raise the Scriptures in our estimation , than to compare the Bible with the Koran and the Vedas . It is not a course of reading to be generally recommended . A portion of the books are scarce , and , as I have said , their contents eminently repulsive ; but I will venture to say to those whose professional duty it is to maintain the sacred character of the Christian Scriptures , that I know of scarce any line of reading which might he taken up with greater advantage , for the purpose of fair comparison , than that of the sacred books , as they are called , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir , and I have done . It is sometimes objected to an indiscriminate distribution of the Bible , that it may be perverted , misunderstood , neglected and abused . And what means of improvement , what instrument of Christian benevolence , is not subject to the same drawback ? The fault is in the mind of man , subject to error , to the blinding effect of passion , to the debasement of vice , in all that he does , and in all that is done for him . There are things in the Bible hard to be understood . And what is there , if we strive to go beyond the mere outside , which does not contain things hard to be understood ? Even our exact sciences , constructed upon ideas which are the creation of our own minds , are full of difficulties . When we turn from revealed truth to the teachings of human speculatists on duty and morals , do we not encounter on the threshold those terrible problems of Providence , foreknowledge , will , and fate- Fixed fate , free will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaided understanding of man ever since he began to think and to reason ? For myself ; Sir , I am more and more inclined to believe that the truth is presented to us in the Bible in the form best adapted to the infinite variety of the character and talent , intellectual and moral , to which it is addressed . It is not such a Bible as the wit of man would bave conceived ; but it is such a one as the nature and wants of man called for . The acceptance it has found , alike in ancient and modern times , with the learned and the ignorant , the old and the young , the high and the low , the prosperous and the wretched , shows that it is really adapted in itself , not to one country , age , or class , but to man ; that it speaks to the unchanging wants , and sorrows , and frailties , and aspirations of the human heart . " We can not omit to say in concluding this article that these volumes exhibit Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prodigy , of industry . If these various speeches and orations had come from some individual whose life had been a scene of literary leisure , we should have considered them less remarkable ; though even then , we should have said that the author had done enough to secure to himself imperishable honour . But when we remember that they are the productions of one , who has , during the whole time , occupied most important civil stations , having been charged with his country 's highest interests both at home and abroad , we are constrained to think that they indicate a degree of industry and facility at labour , of which there is scarcely an example in a generation . We meet Mr. Everett here as the // accomplished scholar and the eloquent orator ; but we meet him also in all his varitrns public relations . It is Professor Everett , and Governor Everett , and President Everett , Mr. Everett the member of Congress and Mr. Everett the ambassador to the court of St. James , with whose literary productions we are so much delighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in connection with these splendid efforts , he has fulfilled with most scrupulous fidelity the duties connected with the several posts of honour and influence which have been assigned to him . Herein he is an illustrious model for all young men who desire to work out for themselves an honotirable destiny ; for though they may not possess his vigour or versatility of talent , and may not aspire to his measure of usefulness or of fame , yet they may imitate him in the economical use of his time and the diligent culture of his powers , and thereby become the benefactors , if not the greater lights , of their generation .
