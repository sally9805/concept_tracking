THE PROFESSOR AT THE BREAKFAST-TABLE . WHAT HE SAID , WHAT HE HEARD , AND WHAT HE SAW . A YOUNG fellow , born of good stock , n one of the more thoroughly civilized portions of these United States of America , bred in good principles , inheriting a social position which makes him at his ease everywhere , means sufficient to educate him thorou* , hly without takiun away the stimulus for vigorous exertion , and with a good opening in some honorable path of labor , is the finest sight our private satellite has had the opportunity of inspecting on the planet to which she belongs . In some respects it was better to be a young Greek . If we may trust the old marbles ,  --  my friend with his arm stretched over my head , above there , . ( in plaster of Paris , ) or the discobolus , whom one may see at the principal sculpture gallery of this metropolis , - those Greek young men were of supreme beauty . Their close curls , their elegantly set heads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , firm chins , deep chests , light flanks , large muscles , small joints , were finer than anything we ever see . It may well be questioned whether the human shape will ever present itself again in a race of such perfect symmetry . But the life of the youthful Greek was local , not planetary , like that of the young American . lie had a string of legends , in place of our Gospels . He had no printed books , no newspaper , no steam caravans , no forks , no soap , none of the thousand cheap conveniences which have become matters of necessity to our modern civilization . Above all things , if he aspired to know as well as to enjoy , he found knowledge not diffused everywhere about him , so that a day 's labor would buy him more wisdom than a year could master , but held in private hands , hoarded in precious manuscripts , to be sought for only as gold is sought in narrow fissures and in the bed of brawling streams . Never , since man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there anything like the condition of the young American of the nineteenth century . Having in possession or in prospect the best part of half a world , with all its climates and soils to choose from ; equipped with wings of fire and smoke that fly with him day and night , so that he counts his journey not in miles , but in degrees , and sees the seasons change as the wild fowl sees them in his annual flights ; with huge leviathans always ready to take him on their broad backs and push behind them with their pectoral or caudal fins the waters that scam the continent or separate the hemispheres ; heir of all old civilizations , founder of that new one which , if all the prophecies of the human heart are not lies , is to be the noblest , as it is the last ; isolated in space from the races that are governed by dynasties whose divine right grows out of human wrong , yet knit into the most absolute solidarity with mankind of all times and places by the one great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form and express his opinions on almost every dubject , and assured that he will soon acquire the last franchise which men withhold from man ,  --  that of stating the laws of his spiritual being and the beliefs he accepts without hindrance except from clearer views of truth ,  --  he seems to want nothing for a large , wholesome , noble , beneficent life . In fact , the chief danger is that he will think the whole planet is made for him , and forget that there are some possibilities left in the de'bris of the old-world civilization which deserve a certain respectful consideration at his hands . The combing arid clipping of this shaggy wild continent are in some measure done for him by those who have gone before . Society has subdivided itself enough to have a place for every form // of talent . Thus , if a man show the least sign of ability as a sculptor or a painter , for instance , he finds the means of education and a demand for his services . Even a man who knows nothing hut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it necessary to hang about his birthplace all his days ,  --  which is a most unAmerican weakness . The apron-strings of an American mother are made of India-rubber . Her boy belongs where he is wanted ; and that young Marylander of ours spoke for all our young men , when he said that his home was wherever the stars and stripes blew over his head . And that leads me to say a few words of this young gentleman , who made that audacious movement lately which I chronicled in my last record ,  --  jumping over the seats of I do n't lCnow how many boarders*to put himself in the place which the Little Gentleman 's absence had left vacant at the side of Iris . When a youn* man is found habitually at the side of any one given young lady ,  --  when he lingers where she stays , and hastens when she leaves ,  - -  when his eyes follow her as she moves , and rest upon her when she is still , - when he begins to grow a little timid , he who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was so gay , whenever accident finds them alone ,  --  when he thinks very often of the given young lady , and names her very seldom ,  - -  What do you say about it , my charming young expert in that sweet science in which , perhaps , a long experience is not the first of qualifications ?  --  but we do n't know anything about this young man , except that he is goodlooking , and somewhat high-spirited , and strong-limbed , and has a generous style of nature , - all very promising , but by no means proving that he is a proper lover for Iris , whose heart we turned inside out when we opened that sealed book of hers . Ah , my dear young friend ! When your mamma - then , if you will believe it , a very slight young lady , with very pretty hair and figure - came and told her mamma that your papa had - hadasked - No , no , no ! she could n't say it ; but her mother-oh , the depth of maternal sagacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When your mother , I say , came and told her mother she was engaged , and your grandmother told your grandfather , how much did they know of the intimate nature of the young gentlema*m to whom she had pledged her existence ? I will not be so hard as to ask how much your respected mamma knew at that time of the intimate nature of your respected papa , fhou*h , if we should compare a young girl 's man-as-she-thinkshim with a forty-summered matron 's *nanas-she-finds-him , I have my doubts as to whether the second would be a fac-simile of the first in most cases . The idea that in this world each young person is to wait until he or she finds that precise counterpart who alone of all creation was meant for him or her , and then fall instantly in love with it , is pretty enough , only it is not Nature 's way . It is not at all essential that all pairs of human beings should be , as we sometimes say of particular couples , " born for each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal better and happier in the end for having had to conquer the faults of the one beloved , and make the fitness not found at first , by gradual assimilation . There is a class of good women who have no right to marry perfectly good men , because they have the power of saving those who would go to ruin but for the guiding providence of a good wife . I have known many such cases . It is the most momentous question a woman is ever called upon to decide , whether the faults of the man she loves are beyond remedy and will drag her down , or whether she is competent to be his earthly redeemer and lift him to her own level . A person of genius should marry a person of character . Genius does not herd with genius . The musk-deer and the civet-cat are never found in compan.y . They do n't care for strange scents , - they lil*e plain animals better than perfumed ones . Nay , if you will have the kindness to notice , // Nature has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which her lord is so widely known . Now when genius allies itself with character , the world is very apt to think character has the best of the bargain . A brilliant woman marries a plain , manly fellow , with a simple intellectual mechanism ; - we have all seen such cases . The world often stares a good deal and wonders . She should have taken that other , with a far more complex mental machinery . She might have had a watch with the philosophical compensation-balance , with the metaphysical index which can split a second into tenths , with the musical chime which can turn every quarter of an hour into melody . She has chosen a plain one , that keeps good time , and that is all . Let her alone ! She knows what she is about . Genius has an infinitely deeper reverence for character than character can have for genius . To bc sure , genius gets the world 's praise , because its work is a tangible product , to be bought , or had for nothing . It bribes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poems , statues , pictures , or whatever it can please with . Character evolves its best products for home consumption ; but , mind you , it takes a deal more to feed a family for thirty years than to make a holiday feast for our neighbors once or twice in our lives . You talk of the fire of genius . Many a blessed woman , who dies unsung and unremembered , has given out more of the real vital heat that keeps the life in human souls , without a spark flitting through her humble chimney to tell the world about it , than would set a dozen theories smoking , or a hundred odes simmering , in the brains of so many men of genius . It is in latent caloric , if I may borrow a philosophical expression , that many of the noblest hearts give out the life that warms them . Cornelia 's lips grow white , and her pulse hardly warms her thin fingers ,  --  but she has melted all the ice out of the hearts of those young Gracchi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youthful heroes . We are always valuing the soul 's temperature by the thermometer of public deed or word . Yet the great sun himself , when he pours his noonday beams upon some vast hyaline boulder , rent from the eternal ice-quarries , and floating toward the tropics , never warms it a fraction above the thirty-two degrees of Fahrenheit that marked the moment when the first drop trickled down its side . How we all like the spirting up of a fountain , seemingly against the law that makes water everywhere slide , rtill , leap , tumble headlong , to get as low as the earth will let it ! That is genius . But *at is this transient upward movement , which gives us the glitter and the rainbow , to that unsleep*ig , all-present force of gravity , the same yesterday , to-day , and forever , ( if the universe be eternal , )  --  the great outspread hand of God himself , forcing all things down into their places , and keeping them there ? Such , in smaller proportion , is the force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are or have been linked to each other in many a household , where one name was historic , and the other , let me say the nobler , unknown , save by some faint reflected ray , borrowed from its lustrous companion . Oftentimes , as I have lain swinging on the water , in the swell of the Chelsea ferry-boats , in that long , sharp-pointed , black cradle in which I love to let the great mother rock me , I have seen a tall ship glide by against the tide , as if drawn by some invisible tow-line , with a hundred strong arms pulling it . Her sails hung unfilled , her streamers were drooping , she had neither side-wheel nor sternwheel ; still she moved on , stately , in serene triumph , as if with her own life . But I knew that on the other side of the ship , hidden beneath the great hulk that swam so majestically , there was a little toiling steam-tug , with heart of fire and arms of iron , that was hugging it close and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the little steam-tug untwined her arms and left the tall ship , it would wal // low and roll about , and drift hither and thither , and go off with the refluent tide , no man knows whither . And so I have known more than one genius , high-decked , full-freighted , wide-sailed , gay-pennoned , that , but for the bare toiling arms , and brave , warm , beating heart of the faithful little wife , that nestled close in his shadow , and clung to him , so that no wind or wave could part them , and dragged him on against all the tide of circumstance , would soon have gone down the stream and been heard of*no more. - No , I am too much a lover of genius , I sometimes think , and too often get impatient with dull people , so that , in their weak talk , where nothing is taken for grante*.l , I look forward to some future possible state of developm*it , when a gesture passing between a beatified human soul and an archangel shall signify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the time when it curdled to the time when its sun was burned out . And yet , when a strong brain is weighed with a true heart , it seems to me like balancing a bubble against a wedge of gold . - It takes a very true man to be a fitting companion for a woman of genius , but not a very great one . I am not sure that she will not embroider her ideal better on a plain ground than on one with a brilliant pattern already worked in its texture . But as the very essence of genius is truthfulness , contact with realities , ( which are always ideas behind shows of form or language , ) nothing is so contemptible as falsehood and pretence in its eyes . Now it is not easy to find a perfectly true woman , and it is very hard to find a perfectly true man . And a woman of genius , who has the sagacity to choose such a one as her companion , shows more of the divine gift in so doing than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of art . I have been a good while coming at a secret , for which I wished to prepare you before telling it . I think there is a kindly feeling growing up between Iris and our young Marylander . Not that I suppose there is any distinct understanding between them , but that the affinity which has drawn him from the remote corner where he sat to the side of the young girl is quietly bringing their two natures together . Just now she is all given up to another but when he no longer calls upon her daily thou , *hts and cares , I warn you not to be surprised , if this bud of friendship open like the evening primrose , with a sound as of a sudden stolen kiss , and lo ! the flower of full-blown love lies unfolded before you . And now the days had come for our little friend , whose whims and weaknesses had interested us , perhaps , as much as his better traits , to make ready for that long journey which is easier to the cripple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters so willingly as he who has borne the life-long load of infirmity during his earthly pilgrimage . At this point , under most circumstances , I would close the doors and draw the veil of privacy over the chamber where the birth which we call death , out of life into the unknown world , is working its mystery . But this friend of ours stood alone in the world , and , as the last act of his life was mainly in harmony with the rest of its drama , I do not here feel the force of the objection commonly lying against that death-bed literature which forms the staple of a certain portion of the press . Let me explain what I mean , so that my readers may think for themselves a little , before they accuse me of hasty e*-pressions . The Roman Catholic Church has certain formulae for its dying children , to which almost all of them attach the reatest importance . There is hardly a criminal so abandoned that he is not anxious to receive the " consolations of religion " in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still living , I think that the form is gone through with , just as baptism is administered to the unconscious new-born child . Now we do not quarrel with these forms . We look with reverence and affection upon all symbols which give peace // and comfort to our fellow-creatures . But the value of the new-born child 's passive consent to the ceremony is null , as testimony to the truth of a doctrine . The automatic closing of a dying man 's lips on the consecrated wafer proves nothing in favor of ' the IReal Presence , or any other doctrine . And , speaking generally , the evidence of dying men in favor of ' any belief is to be received with great caution . They commonly tell the truth about their present feelings , no doubt . A dying man 's deposition about anything he knows is good evidence . But it is of much less consequence what a man thinks and says when he is changed by pain , weakness , apprehension , than what he thinks when he is truly and wholly himself ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , expecting to go to glory at once ; yet no man believes he shall meet a larger average of ' pirates and cutthroats in the streets of ' the New Jertisalem than of ' honest folks that died in their beds . Unfortunately , there has been a very great tendency to make capital of various kinds out of dying men 's speeches . The lies that have been put into their mouths for this purpose are endless . The prime minister , whose last breath was spent in scolding his nurse , dies with a magnificent apothegm on his lips ,  --  manufactured by a reporter . Addison gets up a tableau and utters an admirable sentiment , - or somebody makes the posthumous dying epigram for him . The incoherent babble of ' green fields is translated into the language of stately sentiment . One would think , all that dying men had to do was to say the prettiest thing they could ,  --  to make their rhetorical point , and then bow themselves politely out of ' the world . Worse than this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' this or that favorite belief . The campfollowers of proselyting sects have come in at the close of every life where they could get in , to strip the languishing soul of its thoughts , and carry them off as spoils . The Roman Catholic or other priest who insists on the reception of his formula means kindly , we trust , and very commonly succeeds in getting the acquiescence of ' the subject of his spiritual surgery . But do not let us take the testimony of ' people who are in the worst condition to form opinions as evidence of the truth or falsehood of that which they accept . A lame man 's opinion of dancing is not good for much . A poor fellow who can neither eat nor drink , who is sleepless and full of ' pains , whose flesh has wasted from him , whose blood is like water , who is gasping for breath , is not in a condition to judge fairly of human life , which in all its m*iin adjustments is intended for men in a normal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the wise Patriarch of ' the Medical Profession among us , that the moral condition of ' patients with disease above the great hreathing-muscle , the diaphragm , is much more hopeful than that of patients with disease below it , in the digestive organs . Many an honest ignorant man has given us pathology when he thought he was giving us psychology . With this preliminary caution I shall proceed to the story of the Little Gentleman 's leaving us . When the divinity-student found that our fellow-boarder was not likely to remain long with us , he , being a young man of tender conscience and kindly nature , was not a little exercised on his behalf . It was undeniable that on several occasions the Little Gentleman had expressed himself with a good deal of freedom on a class of ' subjects which , according to the divinity-student , he had no right to form an opinion upon . He therefore considered his future welfare in jeopardy . The Muggletonian sect have a very odd way of dealing with people . If I , the Professor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall he no question through all that persuasion that I am competent to judge of that doctrine ; nay , I shall be quoted as evidence of ' its truth , while I live , and cited , after I am dead , as S // testimony in its behalf ; but if I utter any ever so slight Anti-Muggletonian sentiment , then I become incompetent to form any opinion on the matter . This , you can not fail to observe , is exactly the way the pseudo-sciences go to work , as explained in my Lecture on Phrenology. iNow I hold that he whose testimony would be accepted in behulf of the Muggletonian doctrine has a right to be heard against it . Whoso offers me any article of belief for my signature implies that I am competent to form an opinion upon it ; and if my positive testimony in its favor is of any value , then my negative testimony against it is also of value . I thought my young friend 's attitude was a little too much like that of the Muggletonians . I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " unsettle " somebody 's faith , - as if faith did not require exercise as much as any other living thing , and were not all the better for a shaking up now and then . I do n't mean that it would be fair to bother Bridget , the wild Irish girl , or Joice Heth , the centenarian , or any other intellectual non-combatant ; but all persons who proclaim a belief which passes judgment on their neighbors must be ready to have it " unsettled , " that is , questioned at all times and by anybod* ,  --  just as one who sets up bars across a thoroughfare must expect to have them taken down by every one who wants to pass , if he is strong enough . Besides , to think of trying to waterproof the American mind against the questions that Heaven rains down upon it shows a misapprehension of our new conditions . if to question everything be unlawful and dangerous , we had better undeclare our independence at once ; for what the Declaration means is the right to question everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old-world order of things is an arrangement of locks and canals , where everything depends on keeping the gates shut , and so holding the upper waters at their level ; but the system under which the young republican American is born trusts the whole unimpeded tide of life to the great elemental influences , as the vast rivers of the continent settle their own level in obedience to the laws that govern the planet and the spheres that surround it . The divinity-student was not quite up to the idea of the commonwealth , as our young friend the Marylander , for instance , understood it . He could not get rid of that notion of private property in truth , with the right to fence it in , and put up a sign-board , thus - ALL TRESPASSERS ARE WARNED OFF THESE GROUNDS He took the young Marylander to task for going to the Church of the Galileans , where he had several times accompanied Iris of late . I am a Churchman ,  --  the young man said ,  --  by education and habit . I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all because I think it has educated me out of its own forms into the spirit of its highest teachings . I think I belong to the " Broad Church , " if any of you can tell what that means . I had the rashness to attempt to answer the question myself . - Some say the Broad Church means the collective mass of good people of all denominations . Others say that such a definition is nonsense ; that a church is an organization , and the scattered good folks are no organization at all . They think that men will eventually come together on the basis of one or two or more common articles of belief , and form a great unity . Do they see what this amounts to ? It means an equal division of intellect ! It is mental agrarianism ! a thing that never was and never will be , until national and individual idiosyncrasies have ceased to exist . The man of thirty-nine beliefs holds the man of one belief a pauper ; he is not going to give up thirty-eight of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temple which bears on its front , " Deo erexit Voltaire . " A church is a garden , I have heard it said , and the illustration was neatly handled . Yes , and there is // no such thing as a broad garden . It must be fenced in , and whatever is fenced in is narrow . You can not have arctic and tropical plants crowing together in it , except by the forcing system , which is a mighty narrow piece of business . You ca n't make a village or a parish or a family think alike , yet you suppose that you can make a world pinch its belief or pad them to a single pattern ! Why , the very life of an ecclesiastical organization is a life of induction , a state of perpetually disturbed equilibrium kept up by another charged body in the neighborhood . If the two bodies touch and share their respective charges , down goes the index of the electrometer ! Do you know that every man has a religious belief peculiar to himself ? Smith is always a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith'sworth of truth , of beauty , of divinity . And Brown has from time immemorial been trying to burn him , to excommunicate him , to anonymous-article him , because be did not take in Brown's-worth of knowledge , truth , beauty , divinity . He can not do it , any more than a pintpot can hold a quart , or a quart-pot he filled by a pint . Iron is essentially the same everywhere and . always ; but the sulphate of iron is never the same as the carbonate of iron . Truth is invariable but the Smithate of truth must always differ from the Brownate of truth . The wider the intellect , the larger and simpler the expressions in which its knowledge is embodied . The inferior race , the degraded and enslaved people , the smallminded individual , live in the details which to larger minds and more advanced tribes of men reduce themselves to axioms and laws . As races and individual minds must always differ just as sulphates and carbonates do , I can not see ground for expecting the Broad Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which of course implies that those who hold the larger number of doctrines as essential shall come down to those who hold the smaller number . These doctrines are to the negative aristocracy what the quarterings of their coats are to the positive orders of nobility . The Broad Church , I think , will never be based on anything that requires the use of language . Freemasonry gives an idea of such a church , and a brother is known and cared for in a strange land where no word of his can be understood . The apostle of this church may be a ( leaf mute carrying a cup of cold water to a thirsting fellow-creature . The cup of cold water does not require to be translated for a foreigner to understand it .. I am afraid the only Broad Church possible is one that has its creed in the heart , and not in the head , - that we shall know its members by their fruits , and not by their words . If you say this communion of well-doers is no church , I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of size , and that , when we find a man a hundred feet high and thirty feet broad across the shoulders , we will look out for an organization that shall include all Christendom . Some of us do practically recognize a Broad Church and a Narrow Church , however . The Narrow Church may be seen in the ship 's boats of humanity , in the long boat , in the jolly boat , in the captain 's gig , lying off the poor old vessel , thanking God that they are safe , and reckoning how soon the hulk containing the mass of their fellow-creatures will go down . The Broad Church is on board , working hard at the pumps , and very slow to believe that the ship will be swallowed up with so many poor people in it , fastened down under the hatches ever since it floated . - All this , of course , was nothing but my poor notion about these matters . I am simply an " outsider , " you know ; only it does n't do very well for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outsiders and insiders ! After this talk of ours , I think these two young people went pretty regularly to the Church of the Galileans . Still they could not keep away from the sweet harmonies and rhythmic litanies of Saint Polycarp on the great Church festival1859.1 757 // days ; so that , between the two , they were so much together , that the boarders began to make remarks , and our landlady said to me , one day , that , though it was noon of her business , them that had eyes could n't help seem ' that there was somethin ' goin ' on between them two young people ; she thought the young man was a very likely young man , though jest what his prospecs was was unbeknown to her ; but she thought he must be doin ' well , and rather guessed he would be able to take care of a femily , if he did n't go to takin ' a house ; for a gentleman and his wife could board a great deal cheaper than they could keep house ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child , and would n't think of hem ' married this five year . They was good boarders , both of em , paid regular , and was as pooty a couple as she ever laid eyes on . To come back to what I began to speak of before , - the divinity-student was exercised in his mind about the Little Gentleman , and , in the kindness of his heart , - for he was a good young man , - and in the strength of his convictions , - for he took it for granted that he and his crowd were right , and other folks and their crowd were wrong , - he determined to brine , the Little Gentleman round to his faith before he died , if he could . So he sent word to the sick man , that he should be pleased to visit him and have some conversation with him ; and received for answer that he would be welcome . The divinity-student made him a visit , therefore , and had a somewhat remarkable conversation with him , which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken by the Little Gentleman . He found him weak , but calm . Iris sat silent by his pillow . After the usual preliminaries , the divinity-student said , in a kind way , that he was sorry to . find him in failing health , that he felt concerned for his soul , and was anxious to assist him in making pa*eparations for the great change awaiting him . I thank you , Sir ,  --  said the Little Gen tleman ; - permit me to ask you , what makes you think I am not ready for it , Sir , and that you can do anything to help me , Sir ? I a ( ldress you only as a fellow-man ,  - -  said the divinity-student ,  --  and therefore a fellow-sinner . I am not a man , Sir - said the Little Gentleman . - I was born into this world the wreck of a man , and I shall not be judged with a race to which I do not belong . Look at this ! - he said , and held up his withered arm. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand here  --  and he laid his own on the region of his misplaced heart . - I have known nothing of the life of your race . When I first came to my consciousness , I found myself an object of pity , or a sight to show . The first strange child I ever remember hid its face and would not come near me . I was a broken-hearted as well as brokenbodied boy . I grew into the emotions of ripening youth , and all that I could have loved shrank from my presence . I became a man in years , and had nothing in common with manhood hut its longings . My life is the dying pang of a worn-out race , and I shall go alone down into the dust , out of this world of men and women , without ever knowing the fellowship of the one or the love of the other . I will not die with a lie rattling in my throat . If another state of being has anything worse in store for me , I have had a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't believe it , Sir ! I have too much faith for that . God has not left me wholly without comfort , even hete . I love this old place where I was born ;  --  the heart of the world beats under the three hills of Boston , Sir ! I love this great land , with so many tall men in it , and so many good , noble women. - His eyes turned l* the silent figure by his pillow. - I have learned to accept meekly what has been allotted to me , but I can not honestly say that I think my sin has been greater than my suffering . I bear the ignorance and the evil-doing of whole generations in my // single person . I never drew a breath of air nor took a step that was not a punishment for another 's fault . I may have had many wrong thoughts , but I can not have done many wrong deeds ,  - -  for my cage has been a narrow one , and I have paced it alone . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men busy and happy , but I had no part in their doings . I have known what it was to dream of the great passions ; but since my mother kissed me before she died , no woman 's lips have pressed my cheek ,  --  nor ever will . - The young girl 's eyes glittered with a sudden film , and almost without a thought , but with a warm human instinct that rushed up into her face with her heart 's blood , she bent over and kissed him . It was the sacrament that washed out the memory of long years of bitterness , and I should hold it an unworthy thought to defend her . The Little Gentleman repaid her with the only tear any of us ever saw him shed . The divinity-student rose from his place , and , turning away from the sick man , walked to the other side of the room , where he bowed his head and was still . All the questions he had meant to ask had faded from his memory . The tests he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for heaven seemed to have lost their virtue , lie could trust the crippled child of sorrow to the Infinite Parent . The kiss of the fair-haired girl had been like a sign from heaven , that angels watched over him whom he was presuming but a moment before to summon before the tribunal of his private judgment . Shall I pray with you ? - he said , after a pause . - A little before he would have said , Shall I pray for you ? - The Christian religion , as taught by its Founder , is full of sentiment . So we must not blame the divinity-student , if he was overcome by those yearnings of human sympathy which p-edominate so much more in the sermons of the Master than in the writings of his successors , and which have made the parable of the Prodigal Son the consolation of mankind , as it has been the stumbling-block of all exclusive doctrines . Pray - said the Little Gentleman . The divinity-student prayed , in low , tender tones , that God would look on his servant lying helpless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember his long years of bondage in the flesh ; that he would deal gently with the bruised reed . Thou hast visited the sins of the fathers upon this their child . Oh , turn away from him the penalties of his own transgressions ! Thou hast laid upon him , from infancy , the cross which thy stronger children are called upon to take up ; and now that he is fainting under it , be Thou his stay , and do Thou succor him that is tempted ! Let his manifold infirmities come between him and Thy judgment ; in wrath remember mercy ! If his eyes are not opened to all thy truth , let thy compassion lighten the darkness that rests upon him , even as it came through the word of thy Son to blind Bartimeus , who sat by the wayside , beg-nino* Many more petitions he uttered , but all in the same subdued tone of tenderness . In the presence of helpless suffering , and in the fast-darkening shadow of the Destroyer , he forgot all but his Christian humanity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . This was the last prayer to which the Little Gentleman ever listened . Some change was rapidly coming over him during this last hour of which I have been , speaking . The excitement of pleading his cause before his self-elected spiritual adviser , - the emotion which overcame him , when the young girl obeyed the sudden impulse of her feelinns and pressed her lips to his cheek , - the thoughts that mastered him while the divinity-student poured out his soul for him in prayer , might well hurry on the inevitable moment . When the divinity-student had uttered his last petition , commending him to the Father through his Son 's intercession , he turned to look upon him before // leaving his chamber . His face was changed . - There is a language of the human countenance which we all understand without an interpreter , though the lineaments belong to the rudest savage that ever stammered in an unknown barbaric dialect . By the stillness of the sharpened features , by the blankness of the tearless eyes , by the fixedness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracted brow , by the dilating nostril , we know that the soul is soon to leave its mortal tenement , and is already closing up its windows and putting out its fires . - Such was the aspect of the face upon which the divinity-student looked , after the brief silence which followed his prayer . The change had been rapid , though not that abrupt one which is liable to happen at any moment in these cases . - The sick man looked towards him. - Farewell , - he said . - I thank you . Leave me alone with her . lArhen the divinity-student had gone , and the Little Gentleman found himself alone with Iris , he lifted his hand to his neck , and took from it , suspended by a slender chain , a quaint , antique-looking key ,  --  the same key I had once seen him holding . He gave this to her , and pointed to a carved cabinet opposite his bed , one of those that had so attracted my curious eyes and set me wondering as to what it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and light the lamp . - The young girl walked to the cabinet and unlocked the door . A deep recess appeared , lined with black velvet , against which stood in white relief an ivory crucifix . A silver lamp hung over over it . She lighted the lamp and came back to the bedside . The dying man fixed his eyes upon the figure of the dying Snviour. - Give me your hand ,  --  he said and Iris placed her right hand in his left . So they remained , until presently his eyes lost their meaning , though they still remained vacantly fixed upon the white image . Yet he held the young girl 's hand firmly , as if it were leading him through some deep-shadowed valley and it was all he could cling to . But presently an involuntary muscular contractio*n stole over him , and his terrible dying grasp held the poor girl as if she were wedged in an engine of torture . She pressed her lips together and sat still . fhe inexorable hand held her tighter and tighter , until she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its gripe . It was one of the tortures of the Inquisition she was suffering , and she could not stir from her place . Then , in her great anguish , she , too , cast her eyes upon that dying figure , and , looking upon its pierced hands and feet and side and lacerated forehead , she felt that she also must suffer uncomplaining . In the moment of her sharpest pain she did not forget the duties of her tender office , but dried the dying man 's moist forehead with her handkerchi*f , even while the dews of agony were glistenin* on her own . How long this lasted she never could tell . Time and thirst are two things you and I talk about ; but the victims whom holy men and righteous judges used to *tretch on their engines knew better what they meant than you or I - What is that great bucket of water for ' ? said the Marchioness de Brinvilliers , before she was placed on the rack. - For you to drink , said the torturer to the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take such a flood to quench the fire in her and so keep her alive for her confession . The torturer knew better than she . After a time not to be counted in minutes , as the clock measures ,  --  without any warning , there came a swift change of his features ; his face turned white , as the waters whiten when a sudden breath passes over their still surface ; the muscles instantly relaxed , and Iris , released at once from her care for the sufferer and from his unconscious grasp , fell senseless , with a feeble cry , - the only utterance of her long agony . Perhaps you sometimes wander in through the iron gates of the Copp 's fill burial-ground . You love to stroll round among the graves that crowd each // other in the thickly peopled soil of that breezy summit . You love to lean on the free-stone slab which lies over the bones of the Mathers ,  --  to read the epitaph of stout John Clark , " despiser of little men and sorry actions , " - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and look upon the splintered slab that tells the old rebel 's story , - to kneel by the triple stone that says how the three Worthylakes , father , mother , and young dau* , hter , died on the same day and lie buried there ; a mystery ; the subject of a moving ballad , by the late BENJAMIN FRANKLIN ,  --  as may be seen in his autobiography , which will explain the secret of the triple gravestone ; though the old philosopher has made a mistake , unless the stone is wrong . Not very far from that you will find a fair mound , of dimensions fit to hold a well-grown man . I will not tell you the inscription upon the stone which stands at its head ; for I do not wish you to be sure of the resting-place of one who could not bear to think that he should be known as a cripple among the dead , after being pointed at so long among the living . There is one sign , it is true , by which , if von @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will at once know it ; but I fear you read carelessly , and must study them more diligently before you will detect the hint to which I allude . The Little Gentleman lies where he longed to lie , among the old names and the old bones of the old Boston people . At the foot of his resting-place is the river , alive with the wings and antennle of its colossal water-insects ; over opposite are the great war-ships , and the long guns , which , when they roar , shake the soil in which he lies ; and in the steeple of Christ Church , hard by , are the sweet chimes which are the Boston boy 's Ranz des Vaches , whose echoes follow him all the world over . In Pace ! I told you a good while ago that the Little Gentleman could not do a better thing than to leave all his money , whatever it might be , to the young girl who has since that established such a claim upon him . He did not , however . A considerable bequest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful remembrance . The telescope through which he was fond of watching the heavenly bodies , and the movements of which had been the source of such odd fancies on my part , is now the property of a Western College . You smile as you think of my taking it for a fieshless human figure , when I saw its tube pointing to the sky , and thought it was an arm under the white drapery thrown over it for protection . So do I smile now ; I belong to the numerous class who are prophets after the fact , and hold my nightmares very cheap by daylight . I have received many letters of inquiry as to the sound resembling a woman 's voice , which occasioned me so many perplexities . Some thought there was no question that he had a second apartment , in which he had made an asylum for a deranged female relative . Others were of opinion that he was , as I once suggested , a " Bluebeard " with patriarchal tendencies , and I have even been censured for introducing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come in and see me , the Professor , some evening when I have nothing else to do , and ask me to play you Tartini 's Devil 's Sonata on that extraordinary instrument in my possession , well known to amateurs as one of the master-pieces of Joseph Guarnerius . The vox lzumana of the great Haerlem organ is very lifelike , and the same stop in the organ of the Cambridge chapel might be mistaken in some of its tones for a human voice ; but I think you never heard anything come so near the cry of a prima donna as the A string and the E string of this instrument . A single fact will illustrate the resemblance . I was executing some tours de force upon it one evening , when the policeman of our district rang the bell sharply , and asked what was the matter in the house . He had heard a woman 's // screams , - he was sure of it . I had to make the instrument sing before his eyes before he could be satisfied that he had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bequeathed to me by the Little Gentleman . Whether it had anything to do with the sounds I heard coming from his chamber , you can form your own opinion - I have no other conjecture to offer . It is not true that a second apartment with a secret entrance was found ; and the story of the veiled lady is the invention of one of the Reporters . Bridget , the housemaid , always insisted that he died a Catholic . She had seen the crucifix , and believed that he prayed on his knees before it . The last circumstance is very probably true ; indeed , there was a spot worn on the carpet just before this cabinet which might be thus accounted for . Why he , whose whole life was a crucifixion , should not love to look on that divine image of blameless suffering , I can not see ; on the contrary , it seems to me the most natural thing in the world that he should . But there are those who want to make private property of everything , and ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think as they do should claim any interest in that infinite compassion expressed in the central figure of the Christendom which includes us all . The divinity-student expressed a hope before the boarders that he should meet him in heaven . - The question is , whether he 'll meet you ,  --  said the young fellow John , rather smartly . The divinitystudent had n't thought of that . However , he is a worthy young man , and I trust I have shown him in a kindly and respectful light . He will get a parish by-and-by ; and , as he is about to marry the sister of an old friend , - the Schoolmistress , whom some of us remember , - and as all sorts of expensive accidents happen to young married ministers , he will be under bonds to the amount of his salary , which means starvation , if they are forfeited , to think all his days as he thought when he was settled ,  --  unless the majority of his people chan , e with him or in advance of him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , except that the faithful discharge of daily duties in his personal relations with his parishioners will make him useful enough in his way , though as a thinker he may cease to exist before he has reached middle age . - Iris went into mourning for the Little Gentleman . Although , as I have said , he left the bulk of his property , by will , to a public institution , he added a codicil , by which he disposed of various pieces of property as tokens of kind remembrance . It was in this way I became the possessor of the wonderful instrument I have spoken of , which had been purchased for him out of an Italian convent . The landlady was coniforted with a small legacy . The following extract relates to Iris : " in consideration of her manifold acts of kindness , but only in token of grateful remembrance , and by no means as a reward for services which can not be compensated , a certain messuage , with all the land thereto appertaining , situate in Street , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the same being the house in which I was born , but now inhabited by several families , and known as the Rookery . ' " Iris had also the crucifix , the portrait , and the red-jewelled ring . The funeral or death's-head ring was buried with him . It was a good while , after the Little Gentleman was gone , before our hoarding-house recovered its wonted cheerfulness . There was a flavor in his whims and local prejudices that we liked , even while we smiled at them . It was hard to see the tall chair thrust away among useless lumber , to dismantle his room , to take down the picture of Leah , the handsome Witch of Essex , to move away the massive shelves that held the books he loved , to pack up the tube through which he used to study the silent stars , looking down at him , like the eyes of dumb creatures , with a kind of stupid half-consciousness , that did not worry him as did the eyes of men and women , - and hardest // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart had always turned and found refuge , in the feelings it inspired , from all the perplexities of his busy brain . It was hard , hut it had to he done . And by-and-by we grew cheerful again , and the breakfast-table wore something of its old look . The Koh-i-noor , as we name ( l the gentleman with the diamond , left us , however , soon after that " little mill , " as the young fellow John called it , where he came off second best . His departure was no doubt hastened by a note from the landlady 's daughter , inclosing a lock of purple hair which she " had valued as a pledge of affection , ere she knew the hollowness of the vows he had breathed , " speedily followed by another , inclosing the landlady 's bill . The next morning he was missing , as were his limited wardrobe and the trunk that held it . Three empty bottles of Mrs. Allen 's celebrated preparation , each of them asserting , on its word of honor as a bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " were all that was left to us of the Koh-inoor . From this time forward , the landlady 's daughter manifested a decided improvement in her style of carrying herself before the boarders . She abolished the odious little flat , gummy side-curL She left off various articles of " jewelry . " She began to help her mother in some of her household duties . She became a regular attendant on the ministrations of a very worthy clergyman , having been attracted to his meetin ' by witnessing a marriage ceremony in which he called a man and a woman a " gentleman " and a " lady , " - a stroke of gentility which quite overcame her . She even took a part in wat she called a Sahbath school , though it was held on Sunday , and by no means on Saturday , as the name she intended to utter implied . All this , which was very sincere , as I believe , on her part , and attended with a great improvement in her character , ended in her bringing home a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as to stand up steeply above his forehead , wearing a pair of green spectacles , and dressed in black broadcloth . His personal aspect , and a certain solemnity of countenance , led me to think he must be a clergyman ; and as Master Benjamin Franklin blurted out before several of us boarders , one day , that " Sis had got a beau , " I was pleased at the prospect of her becoming a minister 's wife . On inquiry , however , I found that the somewhat solemn look which I had noticed was indeed a professional one , but not clerical . He was a young undertaker , who had just succeeded to a thriving business . Things , I believe , are going on well at this time of writing , and I am glad for the landlady 's daughter and her mother . Sextons and undertakers are the cheerfullest people in the world at home , as comedians and circus-clowns are the most melancholy in their domestic circle . As our old boarding-house is still in existence , I do not feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present condition of each and all of its inmates . I am happy to say , however , that they are all alive and well , up to this time . That kind old gentleman who sat opposite to me is growing older , as old men will , but still smiles benignantly on all the boarders , and has come to be a kind of father to all of them , - so that on his birthday there is always something like a family festival . The Poor Relation , even , has warmed into a filial feeling towards him , and on his last birthday made him a beautiful present , namely , a very handsomely bound copy of Blair 's celebrated poem , " The Grave . " The young man John is still , as he says , " in fust-rate fettle . " I saw him spar , not long , since , at a private exhibition , an ( l do himself great credit in a setto with henry Finnegass , Esq. , a professional gentleman of celebrity . I am pleased to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in consequence of his rise in office , has taken an apartment somewhat lower down than number " forty-'leven , " as he facetiously called his attic . Whether there is any truth , or not , in the story of his attachment // to , and favorable reception by , the daughter of the head of an extensive wholesale grocer 's establishment , I will not venture an opinion ; I may say , however , that I have met him repeatedly in company with a very well-nourished and high-colored young lady , who , I understand , is the daughter of the house in question . Some of the boarders were of opinion that Iris did not return the undisguised attentions of the handsome young Marylander . Instead of fixing her eyes steadily on him , as she used to look upon the Little Gentleman , she would turn them away , as if to avoid his own . They often went to church together , it is true ; but nobody , of course , supposes there is any relation between religious sympathy and those wretched " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is commonly agreed that nothing better is based than society , civilization , friendship , the relation of husband and wife , and of parent and child , and which many people must think were singularly overrated by the Teacher of Nazareth , whose whole life , as I said before , was full of sentiment , loving this or that young man , pardoning this or that sinner , weeping over the dead1 mourning for the doomed city , blessing , and perhaps kissing , the little so that the Gospels are still cried over almost as often as the last work of fiction ! But one fine June morning there rumbled up to the door of our boardinghouse a hack containing a lady inside and a trunk on the outside . it was our friend the lady-patroness of Miss* Iris , the same who had been called by her admiring pastor " The Model of all thc Virtues . " Once a week she had written a letter , in a rather formal hand , but full of good advice , to her young charge . And now she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had learned all she was likely to learn under her present course of teaching . The Model , however , was to stay awhile , - a week , or more , - before they should leave together . Iris was obedient , as she was bound to be . She was respectful , grateful , as a child is with a just , but not tender *parent* Yet something was wrong . She had one of her trances , and became statue-like , as before , only the day after the Model 's arrival . She was wan and silent , tasted nothing at table , smiled as if by a forced effort , and often looked vaguely away from those who were looking at her , her eyes just glazed with the shining moisture of a tear that must not be allowed to gather and fall . Was it grief at parting from the place where her strange , e friendship had grown up with the Little Gentleman ? Yet she seemed to have become reconeiled to his loss , and rather to have a deep feeling of gratitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his last weary days . The Sunday after the Model 's arrival , that lady had an attack of headache , and was obliged to shut herself up in a darkened room alone . Our two young friends took the opportunity to go together to the Church of the Galileans . They said but little going , - " collecting their thoughts " for the service , I devoutly hope . My kind good friend the pastor preached that day one of his sermons that make us all feel like brothers and sisters , and his text was that affectionate one from John , " My little children , let us not love in word , neither in tongue , hut in deed and in truth . " When Iris and her friend came out of church , they were both pale , and walked a space without speaking . At last the young man said , - You and I are not little children , Iris ! She looked in his face an instant , as if startled , for there was something strange in the tone of his voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In deed and in truth , Iris , What shall a poor girl say or do , when a strong man falters in his speeeh before her , and can do nothing better than hold out his hand to finish his broken sen-tenee ? The poor girl said nothing , but quietly laid her ungloved hand in his , - the littie // soft white hand which had ministered so tenderly and suffered so patiently . The blood came back to the young man 's cheeks , as he lifted it to his lips , even as they walked there in the street , touched it gently with them , and said ,  --  " It is mine ! " Iris did not contradict him . The seasons pass by so rapidly , that I am startled to think how much has happened since these events I was describing . Those two young people would insist on having their own way about their own affairs , notwithstanding the good lady , so justly called the Model , insisted that the a , e of twenty-five years was as early as any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. , etc . Long before Iris had reached that are , she was the wife of a young Maryland engineer , directing some of the vast constructions of his native State , - where he was growing rich fast enou* , h to be able to decline that famous Russian offer which would have made him a kind of nabob in a few years . Iris does not write verse often , nowadays , but she sometimes draws . The last sketch of hers I have seen in my Southern visits was of two children , a boy and girl , the youngest holding a silver goblet , like the one she held that evening when I - I was so struck with her statue-like beauty . If in the later summer months you find the grass marked with footsteps around that grave on Copp 's Hill I told you of , and flowers scattered over it , you may be sure that Iris is here on her annual visit to the home of her childhood and that excellent lady whose only fault was , that Nature had written out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rub out the lines . One thing morel must mention . Being on the Common , last Sunday , I was attracted by the cheerful spectacle of a well-dressed and somewhat youthful papa wheeling a very elegant little carriage containing a stout baby . A buxom young lady watched them from one of the stone seats , with an interest which could be nothing less than maternal . I at once recognized my old friend , the young fellow whom we called John . He was delighted to see me , introduced me to " Madam , " and would have the lusty infant out of the carriage , and hold him up for me to look at . Now , then , - he said to the two-yearold , - show the gentleman how you hit from the shoulder . - Whereupon the little imp pushed his fat fist straight into my eye , to his father 's intense satisfaction . Fust-rate little chap , - said the papa . - Chip of the old block . Regl'r little Johnny , you know . I was so much pleased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about one of " them little articles " he seemed to want so much , that I took my " punishment " at the hands of the infant pugilist with great equanimity .  --  and how is the old hoarding-house ? -I asked . A 1 ,  --  he answered . - Painted and papered as good as new . Gahs in all the rooms up to the sky-parlors . Old womart 's layin ' up money , they say . Means to send Ben Franklin to college . - Just then the first bell rang for church , and my friend , who , I understand , has beoome a most exemplary member of society , said he must be off to get ready for ineetin ' , and told the young one to " shake dada , " which he did with his closed fist , in a somewhat menacing manner . And so the young man John , as we used to call him , took the pole of the miniature carriage , and pushed the small pugilist before him homewards , followed , in a somewhat leisurely way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sigh and a smile after him . That evening , as soon as it was dark , I could not help going round by the old boarding-house . The " gahs " was lighted , but the curtains , or , more properly , the painted shades , were not down . And so I stood there and looked in along the table where the boarders sat at the evening meal , - our old breakfast-table , which some of us feel as if we knew so well . There were new faces at it , but // also old and familiar ones . - The landlady , in a wonderfully smart cap , looking young , comparatively speaking , and as if half the wrinkles had been ironed out of her forehead . - 11cr daughter , in rather dressy half-mourning , with a vast brooch of jet , got up , apparently , to match the gentleman next her , who was in black costume and , sandy hair , - the last rising straight from his forehead , like the marble dame one sometimes sees *t the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in absolute black , but in a stuff with specks of white ; as much as to say , that , if there were any mQre Hirams left to sigh for her , there were pin-holes in the night of her despair , through which a ray of hope might find its way to an adorer. - Master Benjamin Franklin , grown taller of late , . was in the act of splitting his face open with a wedge of pie , so that his features were seen to disadvantage for the moment . - The good old gentleman was sitting still and thoughtful . All at once he turned his face toward the window where I stood , and , just as if he had seen me , smiled his benignant smile . It was a recollection of some past pleasant moment ; but it fell upon me like the blessing of a father . I kissed my hand to them all , unseen as I stood in the outer darkness ; and as I turned and went my way , the table and all around it faded into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so my year 's record is finished .

The Oxford Museum . By HENRY W. AcLAND , M. D. , Regius Professor of Medicine , and JOHN HUSKIN , M. A. , Honorary Student of Christ Church . London , 1859 . THE last ten years have formed a remarkable period in the history of the ancient and honored University of Oxford . Guided by wise and discerning counsels , it has made rapid and substantial advance . The scope of its studies has been greatly enlarged , the standard of its requirements raised . Its traditionary adherence to old methods and its bigoted conservatism have been overcome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the times and adapted itself to the new desires and growing needs of men . Its aristocratic prejudices have not been allowed longer to confine its privileges and its operations to one class alone of the community ,  --  and in identifying itself 4th the system of middle-class education , Oxford has won new claims to gratitude and to respect , and now exercises a wider and more confirmed authority over the thought of England than ever before . To us , who take pride in her ancient fame , who honor her long and rhemorable services in the cause of good learning , who cherish the memory of the great and good men , the masters of modern thought , whom she has nurtured , who recall the names of our own forefathers who came out from her and from her sister University with will and *0 *er to lay the foundations of our state , and whom , by her discipline , in the midst of all the refinement of books and the quietness of study , she had prepared to meet and to overcome the hardshios of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of truth and freedom ,  --  to us it may well be matter of rejoicing to witness the freshness of her spirit and the spring of her perennial youth ,  --  to see her " so famous , So excellent in art , and still so rising . " One of the most marked features of the advance that has lately been made is the full recognition of the Natural Sciences as forming an essential part of the scheme of University studies . For centuries there had been an " intellectual onesidedness " at Oxford . It had chiefly cultivated classic learning . But it has now undertaken to repair the deficiency that existed in this respect , and , while still retaining all its classic studies , it has added to them a full course of training in the knowledge of Nature . " Our object is , " says Dr. Ad. ad , speaking as one of the professors of the University , " oar object is ,  --  first , to give the learner a general view of the planet on which he lives , of its constituent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world a . ong worlds ; and secondly , to enable him to study , in the most complete scientific manner , and for any purpose , any detailed portion which his powers qualify him to grasp . " Such an object brings the University into full s ; mpathy with the present tendencies of education in our own country . With us , scientific pursuits and the study of Nature are receiving greater and greater attention and engrossing a continually larger share of the interest , the time , and the talent of students . There already exists , and there is danger of its increase , in many of our best institutions of learning , and many of our most educated men , an intellectual onesidedness of a contrary , but not less untortun* to character , to that which long existed at Oxford . The temper of our people , the wide field for their energies , the development of the so-called practical traits of character under the stimulus of our political and social institutions , the solitary dissociation of America from the history and the achievements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of monuments of past greatness and worth ,  --  these and ma y other circumstances peculiar to our position all serve to weaken the gemeral interest in what are called classical studies , and to direct the attention of the most ambitious and active minds far too exclusively to the pursuits of science . And when to these circumstances peculiar to ourselves is added the influence of those general causes which have had the e ect of leading men throughout the civilized world // to give of late years more and more of thought and study to the investigation of Nature and to the pursuits resulting therefrom , it is not strange that learning , socalled , should , for the present at least , find itself hut podrly off in America , and that the essential value of learned studies for an even and fair development of the intellectual faculties should he far too little regarded . The danger that arises from a too exclusive devotion to scientific pursuits is pointed out hy Dr. Acland in a passage which deserves thoughtful consideration , coming as it does from a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cultivated intellect . " The further my observation has extended , " he says , " the more satisfied I am that no knowledge of things will supply the place of the early study of letters , - literce liemaniores . I do not doubt the value of any honest mental labor . Indeed , since the materiel working of the Creator has been so far displayed to our gaze , it is both dangerous and full of impiety to resist its ennobling influence , even on the ground that His morel work is greater . But notwithstanding this , the study of language , of history , and of the thoughts of great men which they exhibit , seems to be almost necessary ( as far as learning is necessary at all ) for disciplining the heart , for elevating the soul , and for preparing the way for the growth in the young of their personal spiritual life ; while , on the other hand , the best corrective to pedantry in scholarship , and to conceit in mental philosophy , is the study of the facts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully acknowledged the need of enlarging her system of education , at once set ahout preparing a home for the Natural Sciences within her precincts . The building of the Oxford Museum is a fact characteristic of the large spirit of the University , and of special interest from the design and nature of its architecture . It is not merely intended for the holding of collections in the different departments of physical science , but it contains also lecture- and work-rooms , and all the accommodations required for in-door study . To provide the mere shell of such a building , the University granted the sum of ? 30,000 . The design that was selected from those which were sent for competition was of the Gothic style , - the work of Messrs . Deane and Woodward ; and this style was chosen because it was believed , that , " in respect of capacity of adaptation to any given wants , Gothic has no superior in any known form of Art , " - and that , this being so , " it was , upon the whole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oxford . " " The centre of the edifice , which is to contain the collections , consists of a quadrangle , " covered by a glass roof . The court is surrounded by an open arcade of two stories . " This arcade furnishes ready means of communication between the several departments and their collections in the area . " " Round the arcade is ranged upon three sides the main block of the building , " - the fourth side being left unoccupied by apartments , to afford means for future extension . Each department of science is provided with ample accommodations , specially adapted to its peculiar needs . The building , as it stands at present , is in its largest dimensions about 330 by 170 feet . Its erection has formed an epoch not only in the history of Oxford , but also in that of Gothic Art in England . It is the first considerable building which has for centuries been erected in England according to the true principles of Gothic Art . It is a revival of the spirit and freedom of Gothic architecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thonoist an fPucy , and imagination . It h. s combined be uty with use , elegance with convenience , and ornament with instruction . It has proved the perfect pliancy of Gothic architecture to modern needs , and shown its power of entire adaptation to the requirements of new conditions . In its details no less than in its general scope it exhibits the recognition by its builders of the essential characteristics of the best Gothic Art , and shows in the harmonized variety of its parts the inventive thought ud the independent execution of many minds and hands presided over by a single will . Gothic architecture in its best development is the expression at once of law and of liberty . The exactest principles of proportion are combined in it with the fl-cost play of fancy . Its spaces are divided mathematically by the rule and the square , its main lines are determined with absolute precision , - but within these limits of order the imagination works out its free results , and , because limited by mathemat // ical laws , reaches the most perfect freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which , " says Mr. Ruskin , " took eight hundred years to mature , gathering its power by undivided inheritance of traditional method , " is not an easy thing to revive under new and difficult conditions . A single example of what has been attempted in this way in the Oxford Museum must suffice to show the spirit which pervades its construction . The lower arcade upon the central court is supported by thirty-three piers and thirty shafts ; the upper arcade by thirty-three piers and ninety-five shafts . " The shafts have been carefully selected , under the direction of the Professor of Geology , from quarries which furnish examples of many of the most important rocks of the British Islands . On the lower arcade are placed , on the west side , the granitic series ; on the east , the metamorphic ; on the north , calcareous rocks , chiefly from Ireland ; on the south , the marbles of England . " The capitals and bases are to represent different groups of plants and animals , illustrating the various geological epochs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sienite from Charn.wood Forest has a capital of the cocoa palm ; the red granite of Ross , in Mull , is crowned with a capital of lilies ; the beautiful marble of Marychurch has an exquisitely sculptured capital of ferns ; - and so through all the range of the arcades , new designs , studied directly from Nature , and combining art with science , have been executed by the workmen employed on the building . To complete the beauty of the court , massive corbels have been thrown out from the piers , upon which statues of the greatest and most famous men in science are to be , or are already , placed . These shafts and capitals and statues have been , in great part , the gift of individuals interested in the progress and successful completion of such a building . The Queen presented five of the statues ; and her example has been followed by many of the graduates of the University and lovers of Art in England . Mr. Ruskin ends his second letter in the little book before us with these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juster expressions of the Gothic principle will be ultimately arrived at by us than any which are possible in the Oxford Museum , its builders will never lose their claim to our chief gratitude , as the first guides in a right direction ; and the building itself the first exponent of . recovered truth , will only be the more venerated , the more it is excelled . " Such is the way in which Oxford , having a Museum to build , sets to work . She lays down a large and generous plan , and erects a building worthy of her ancient fame , worthy to increase the love and honor in which she is held , - a building that adds a new beauty to her old beauties of hall and chapel , of quadrangle and cloister . She does not mistake parsimony for economy ; she does not neglect to regard the duty that lies upon her , as the guardian and instructress of youth , to set before their eyes models of fair proportion , noble structures which shall exercise at once an influence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellect . She acknowledges the claims of the future as well as of the present , and does not erect that which the future , however it may advance in constructive power , will regard as base , mean , or ugly . She recognizes the value to herself , as well as to her sons , of all those associations which , through the power of her adorned and munificent architecture , shall bind them to her in ties of closer tenderness , and of strong , though most delicate feeling . Her building is to have an aspect that shall correspond to the nobility of its function ,  --  that shall impress the student , as he walks along the hard and dry paths of science , with some sense , faint though it be , of the beauty of that learning which is furnished with so goodly an abode . The influence of a fine building , complete in all its parts , is one which can not be estimated in money , can not be investigated by any practical process , but which is nerertheless as strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is unobserved . It would seem that there could be no country in the world where buildings of the noblest kind would be more desired than in America , for there is none in which they are so much needed . But such is not the case . As men who have lived long in darkness become so accustomed to the want of light as not to feel its absence , so the absoluteness of the want of fine buildings in America prevents that want from being generally felt . Heirs of the intehlec // December , Thai wealth of the past , we have no inheritance of the great works of its hands . No material heirlooms have been transmitted to us . We are cut off from any share in the monuments on which the labor , the affection , and the possessions of former generations were expended . The precious and enlarging associations connected with such works , which bind successive generations of men together with ties of memory and reverence , stimulating the imagination to new conceptions , and nerving the will to large efforts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barren and naked ; and , moreover , no effort is made to relieve the future from the want which the present feels so keenly . With wealth ample enough for undertakings of any magnitude ,  --  with intelligence , more boasted than real , but still sufficient for the conception of improvement , we exhibit in our civilization neither the taste nor the capacity for any noble works of Art . The value of beauty is disregarded , and the cultivation of the sense of beauty is treated as of little worth , compared with the culture of what are styled the practical faculties . Our wealth is spent in the erection of extravagant stores and shops-in the decoration of oyster-saloons , hotels , and steamboats ,  - -  in the lavish and selfish adornment of drawing-rooms and chambers . In the whole breadth of the continent there is not a single building of such be*iuty as to he an object of national pride , and few which will have any value in future times , except as historic records of the poverty of sentiment and the deficiency . of character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endowed University has , like Oxford , lately engaged in the erection of a Museum , which , though more limited in its general object , has yet a scope of such large and generous proportion as to make it a work of even more than national interest . It is undertaken on such a scale as to fit it not merely for present needs , but for the increasing wants of later times . The state has contributed to it from the public *reasury , and private citizens have given their contributions liberally towards its support . The building has been rapidly carried forward , and the portion undertaken is now near completion* How does it compare with the Oxford Museum l What provision has been made that in its outward aspect it shall correspond with the worth and grandeur of the collections it is to hold and the studies that are to be carried on within it l What patient thought , what stores of imagination , what happy adaptations do its walls reveal l These questions are easily answered . Convenience of internal arrangement has been sought without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Art . The architect has , we must suppose , been obliged to conform his plans to the most frugal estimates ; but we can not help thinking , that , generous as the State has been , it would have been more worthy of her , had no such necessity existed . The huilding for the Museum is one which can never excite high admiration , never touch any chord of poetic sentiment , never arouse in the student within its walls any feeling save that of mere convenience and utility . Its bare , shadowless walls , unadorned hy caryen columns or memorial statues , will stand incapable of affording support for those associations which endear every human work of worth , covering it with praise and remembrance , as the ivy clings to the stone , adding beauty to beauty ,  - -  associations which make men proud of their ancestors and desirous to equal them in achievement . The University at Cambridge , just entering on the second quarter of its third century , has not a single building that is beautiful , perhaps we mi*ht say none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a future when our people shall become enlightened and magnanimous enough to appreciate noble architecture at its true worth , as the expression of the greatness of national character , as an enduring record of faith and of truth , and *s an essential instrument in any system of education that professes to be complete .
