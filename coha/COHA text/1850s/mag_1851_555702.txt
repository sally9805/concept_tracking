txt ART . IV . - Christian Consolations . Sermons ' designed to furnish Comfort and Strength to the Afflicted . By A. P. PEABODY , Pastor of the South Church , Portsmouth , N. H. Second Edition . Boston : Crosby &amp; Nichols , 1851. 12mo. pp. 367 . WE have read this volume with admiration of its fitness to its design , of the vigor of its style , and the resources of experience and learning it implies . But our regard has been still more strongly drawn to the decided stand taken in it throughout , as to the character of true religion and the importance of the Christian faith ; and though we have no space for the large discussion of topics so momentous , we have thought that our readers might entertain a brief treatment of questions alike the most fundamental and the most vexed of our own as well as other days . Our last number , in one of its articles , treated of the relations of science and religion . Welcoming the suggestions therein made , as to the peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as rivals , but as friends , we would continue the subject to such points of observation as the book under notice suggests . Is religion the child of nature , or a descendant from the skies ? born of the earth , or the immediate daughter of God ? // discovered by the human mind , or revealed by divine inspiration ? Through whatever variety of terms the statement may be made , this is the great inquiry . Our author is most earnest and constant in his position , that all true religion , and Christianity in particular , as the highest form of religion , though regarded by some in these times as a mere result of the progress of knowledge and the development of our own understanding , is supernaturally derived . On this ground , we are in perfect sympathy and full communion with him . We must express astonishment at the character of the speculations to which some have been led by holding to the opposite opinion . To these persons , nothing but the mud beneath and man upon it seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no heavenly communication , no assured immortality . But it is instructive to notice that the same curious scene , which in past ages has often appeared on the stage of unbelief , is now acted over again , in the skepticism that actually prevails . Those who deny any thing miraculous or superhuman in Jesus Christ , are often by np means slow to greet the pretence of miracle when it comes with dubious signs and from weak vessels . It would seem as if the mind of man , from its very constitution , was made for something beyond nature , and must have food that grows on no earthly soil ; and therefore , when it has rejected the mighty works of God and the " loaves ' * from the hand of Christ , it must try to nourish itself on the husks of superstition . The belief in something which is above or beyond nature , though expelled from its rightful dominion and denied in its legitimate proofs , is still loth to go ; it has a secret handle in the soul to which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenge , haunt its formal and showily wise rejecter with apparitions and enormous fancies , deceptive shadows of the lost substance . In the judgment of many , this is the period for finally exploding all belief in miracles , and for reducing all the facts of history to simple and intelligible laws , casting out as false whatever falls not under the measure of these laws . But is it not the period also , to mention no other class of prodigies , of the Rochester knockings , now announced as speedily to become universal ? And are not they , who are most deaf to the claims of the Great Teacher , most willing to lend their ear to this vulgar appeal ? They will not believe that the son of // God healed the sick and raised the dead , but they will admit that spirits from the eternal world have been rapping on their tables ! Truly , as one said , they who believe not what they ought , are prepared to believe all they ought not . The glorious doctrines and momentous precepts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvellous deeds ; while the shallow and trivial messages of these newcomers from the spirit-land raise no doubt that the celestial gates have been indeed opened . They are not even staggered by the fact ihat , if the personages supposed are veritably with them , some of them , at least , do not seem to have profited by their sojourn among the exalted privileges of that mysterious , transcendent state . We can personally testify that Dr. Channing , who appears to be a favorite spirit with these summoners of witnesses from beyond the grave , does not , to our thinking , converse and reason as well as he did on earth . It is certainly a marvel , even in this century of wonders , that events in the Christian history , buttressed with pillar* of testimony of unparalleled strength , must be set aside or explained away into myth and hallucination , while credulity opens her hungry mouth for every sign of fresh portents , as though Thomas Browne 's opinion still prevailed , that there are not miracles enough . But with this craving for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tendency on the other towards exclusive trust in mere physical science , represented perhaps most conspicuously in the doctrines of the French philosopher , Auguste Comte . Positive knowledge , which proceeds only by the development of constant and well-ascertained laws , is the idol of his mind and of other minds like his , ignoring as wholly beyond human reach the Ordainer of these laws , and the purpose for which they were ordained . Even in such minds , there must sometimes be a reaction , and an assertion by the supernatural element of its rights . Meantime , as an argument from reason itself for the religion of Jesus , we must affirm that they violate human nature , at least , who attempt to limit it to the information derived from the senses and to the conclusions of the inductive faculty . A whole class of the soul 's powers and manifestations are thus put under the ban ; and as these are real powers and great manifestations , we see not why it is any more in the spirit of true philosophy to // deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , or overlook as insignificant , in the sum of the universe , a fish or a fixed star . We rejoice that some of our most distinguished men of science are not disposed to banish them from their domain , but to do them hospitable justice . We would maintain not only their legitimacy , but their independence and superiority . The truths of religion are not , or they are but very partially , the deductions of natural science . Some truths , essential to the soul 's peace and salvation , lie wholly beyond the scope of unaided human wisdom , and , as all history proves , can not , even by the masters of earthly knowledge , be drawn out of any hiding-places in the material world . Nature , to use a Baconian phrase , must he noted as defective . She can tell us of the divine strength , and skill , and goodness . But we want to know , not only whether there is understanding with the Most High , but also whether he loves us as his children , cares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our sins , and rescue us from the swift decays of mortality for an endless . being . There are many such questions , which nature can not answer , nor can our own minds respond with a confidence at all equal to the eagerness with which they are asked . God 's inspiration through his Son gives the reply , and has thus for itself the twofold support of its own demonstration and of the natural want which it meets . This light from heaven transfigures , indeed , the outward nature that could not he its source , making it no longer , as to the man of mere science , a skeleton of lines and laws , like Boscovich 's arrangement of all creation as a series of mathematical points , but alive and breathing with the Maker 's being and benignity . The ancients guessed and groped to find , within the material globe , the globe of spiritual truth , and felt after God , if haply they might find him ; and modern writers have sometimes ridiculed the old sages and schoolmen for placing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort , but in contemplation . The antique scholar 's scorn of the homely applications of wisdom was doubtless an error or exaggeration ; hut it was a more generous error , a nobler exaggeration , than to regard the whole , which they called order or beauty , as made to minister to sordid gain and sensual pleasure . The office of the wind as the messenger // of heaven is grander than the service it renders by merely filling the sails of our ships ; and an eclipse , superstitiously interpreted as the frown of God upon wickedness , has a nobler langua0e for the soul than when only made the basis of a calculation . And though the trophies of this age are not to he despised , but admitted ; though we can pencil a diagram to measure the earth , and throw it into our scales to be weighed ; though we can groove its rocks and hills for our roads ; hend its vapor into our motive power ; make of its lightnin* , our pen ; and , like a conjuror , draw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sepulchres of its ancient forms of animated being , where they have been interred through unimaginable cycles of duration ; we need still more than all this , to know from God , through some direct messenger , that the earth itself is but the primary school of boundless instruction , and a stepping-stone for his faithful ones to a higher sphere . Science herself is , we know , a religious teacher of important truth , and perhaps she may he m*n illustrator of all truth ; but , beyond this world , the spiritual world alone can be the fountain of that knowledge of God which the soul needs for its sustenance and hope ; while it is preposterous , or a sheer absurdity , to suppose the Almighty limited in his commumcations to the one channel of his outward works , and unable to choose secret or supernatural ways to his children 's minds . Why not admit organs and faculties to receive him in these ways , to be as legitimate parts of our nature as are our senses and logical understanding ? Have we not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as for generalization from particulars ? and does not every one , who ever had an idea , know that it is a very different thing from a generalization , however broad and exhausting , - that it is even the visitation of a spiritual power ? And if such a being as Jesus Christ comes to live in the world , affirming that he is at the same time in the bosom of the Father , that he takes the things of God to give to men ; even aside from this peculiar proof of his mission , shall any one presume to scorn the very proposition as incredible , because not lying on the plane of scientific observation ? If Paul , with his lordly intellect , says he " knows " he is immortal , shall his declaration be denounced as a weakness and delusion , on the assumption that no human // perception can reach to such a fact ? A man with a telescope may see a world which can not be discovered by another man with the naked eye . The worldly , irreligious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for science and those for religion are diverse , and the processes by which they operate are distinct . What mensuration or arithmetic , what acuteness of sense , precision of analysis , or embracing under one form multitudinous particulars , can compass or realize the things that are spiritual ? For these , there must be other conditions in the sensibilities , meditations , and prayers of the soul . Science and religion can be in concord only when , occupying aright their respective provinces , they have a hold in proportion to their relative importance on the human soul . But physical science must be the servant , and , in some sense , the expounder , of religion , placing truths too vast for comprehension , or too dazzling for steady sight , in her secondary illumination , while she does her own work of richly furnishing with facts and rules the human mind . We had intended to make some remarks on the Bible as the organ of spiritual truth . This book of books has been greatly wronged in being regarded as designed to convey literal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , in Genesis , of the creation , is now a field of battle between the students of Scripture and the students of the world . This strife ought to cease , from the consideration , that no theoretic cosmogony is , in that book , intended to be built up in the understanding , but only a picture drawn to fill the dormant imagination and move the religious sensibilities of the soul . It is not to be supposed , that the author himself of that wonderful painting presumed that be was giving a literal narration how , or in what precise intervals of time , God made the world . Nevertheless , his sketch stands with unaltered lines and in unfading colors , and , fearless of a rival , holds , through all generations , its bright ideas of the creative work before the human soul . The reason is plain . A literal , is not the only legitimate , or the highest , account of such a thing as the creation of God . Nay , - there is , has been , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As we feel we do not violate the truth of the world when we speak of it phenomenally , or as its operations // appear , but not as they mathematically are , and say the sun rises and sets , instead of saying the earth turns on its axis ; so , may there not be a poetic as well as a physical way of describing the material universe , genius no less than fact having her story to tell , and inspiration , as well as observation , a discourse to deliver ? How lawful this claim may be is manifest when we inquire whether , with all these marvellous advantages of the progress of science , the geologist has given us any better delineation of the creative energy and the original manner of its proceeding , than we find in that old , but never antiquated map , which holds fast its tracery on the page where it was printed more than three thousand years ago . Can any modern pencil portray the same subject for the same end , of quickening the religious sentiment , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ancient masterpiece , the scene is alive , and the figures move ; the elements sublimely stir themselves at the Maker 's word light and heat , air and moisture , run like servants on his errands , and range themselves in the proportions of his design ; while in and over all , God is ever supreme with his spirit and law , his wisdom and love . In the Scripture point of view , of religious knowledge , what can any discoveries in natural science , any mineralogy or chemistry , any comparison of strata , dislodgment of fossil remains , or enumeration of *eons , do more than repeat and confirm , without contradicting , the effect of such a narrative on the common heart ? The Old Testament has sometimes been characterized as one of those petrifactions of formerly living creatures which modern science unearths . But not thus . As a classic author finely says of the world , that it does not grow old , so this Testament , ancient like the world , is like it too in being ever fresh . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some skeptical thinkers , is vain against the true scholar 's testimony and the facts in the case . The wonderful hook of God still lives , and keeps alive customs and languages that would otherwise have long since been dead . Its light , like the sunshine , flows from the fountain of light , and its gracious dew falls every day , as out of the windows of heaven . The whole Bible has an organic hold of us . While we criticize it , it lies far back at the root of our being , and is the " meat " upon which we have " grown so great . " It is not maintained // by us , but has borne us ; and any hostility to it is a quarrel with the benefactor of our infancy and childhood , and a suicidal war against the vitality of our existence . Upon its " sincere milk " our ancestry and the heart of the world have been nourished ; nor can we tell from how great moral evil we have been saved , or how largely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this vast , deep , original power . It is the spring of an endless current of poetry , eloquence , converse , commentary , and quotation . A book , - it is the mother of books , the begetter of huge folios , the nurse of literature , destined to survive all its outward progeny , and be coeval with the memory of the soul . But we must tear ourselves from so great and inviting a theme . The relations of religion to science open a vista of thought into which we have been able only to glance . To the divine mind , the two may be identical . To the human mind , they can be generally discriminated , but not by any distinctions that cut through so as to part them entirely ; for , though distinguishable , they are wedded , and should never be divorced . Speaking not categorically , but we think with substantial correctness , we should describe their diversity thus - they differ in their sources . Science comes from the world of appearances and arrangements ; religion from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct light , upon the soul . Science alone can not build up her tower unto the heavens , and , attempting to do so , ends only in a confusion of tongues . All our knowledge is Babel without the inspiration of God . The truth of his being , character , and will escapes the survey of the senses , and foils every effort of the scientific intellect . The author of that truly interesting little work , entitled the " Stars and the Earth , " fails , we think , in the endeavor to give us an understanding of the Divine omniscience . No calculations of space and time , no material pictures , can compass it . It can only be hinted at by the outward world . It is no mechanical estimate , or argumentative inference , but an idea , which the finger of God must write on the tables of the heart . For religion and science , differing in their sources , differ also in the faculties which they exercise , and in the processes by which they are apprehended , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resources of this world , religion disclosing the // realities of another ; science improving the outward lot of man , religion his inward character ; while both agree , in their true estate , to give li , ht and bear fruit for the joy and blessing of man . If we may dwell for a moment on another distinction , we would say that science deals with effects , and from them builds her temple ; religion goes to the cause and origin of all , and , in her highest form , bestows the ineffable delight of communion with the First Cause , the beginning and centre of the world . All are familiar with Paley 's famous illustration , in his Natural Theology , of the watch , as an indubitable evidence of design . If there be a watch , it is clear there must be a watchmaker . But if we could see the watchmaker himself , and become acquainted with the motions of his mind , we should have a more satisfactory knowledge than by examining all the works of his hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the works into fellowship with the spirit of God . In this vital fellowship , there is a persuasion and happiness , a motive to effort and a comfort in trial , which no study of nature , no investigations of human science , can afford . So those most profound in science are most ready to confess and declare . When religionists on the one hand shall be delivered from sectarian dogmas , and the whole school of science on the other from resting in second causes , the gospel of Christ will , with the providence of God , freely produce this experience , and vindicate it as the most blessed of facts . We may seem to have been drawn away from our author by this train of general discourse . But we have been only as a fellow-traveller with him in his own frequented paths . We have been but measuring out some of the foundations of his work , and breathing the familiar spirit of bis thought . We have the more willingly taken his labors as an opportunity for these reflections , because there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edition of his book . Lie is no aspirant for public favor , whose fortunes might be in any manner determined by what we should say , but an accepted teacher , with an established position before the whole reading as well as the hearing community . As a valued contributor to our own pages , and a minister in many ways , far and wide , of the spirit of the gospel , his claim is amply acknowledged . Not a word we could utter is needful to set forth the pure and // lofty character of his entire influence . The train of thought we have been pursuing is the best index xve could make of the intellectual and moral stand he has taken , and the truest commentary we can offer on the doctrine and spirit of his last publication . In a time of hold skepticism , and in a quarter where unbelief dealt her fiercest blows , he has stood forth as a defender and expounder of the Bible . While a new naturalism has been introduced among us , and what is almost the worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has lifted up his voice earnestly in the cause of supernatural truth . We have to thank him for his fidelity to the gospel he was set to maintain , and for his large services in its pure promulgation . Though having no lack of decision and candor as a theologian , he has never ground in any sectarian mill , but has published his convictions for the good of the whole church , with the freedom and breadth of Christian faith . In so doing , he has shown his respect to that simplicity and godly sincerity , which , combined with a catholic love , alone can tend to unite believers of every name in one great communion . The tone of this volume of Christian Consolations * is one eminently of good-will and holy fellowship with all ; and , while bearing throughout the stamp and color of an affectionate sentiment suited to its design , it equally shows the rare ability to carry deep into the soul the comforts of which it treats . Its style is one of signal clearness and vigor , and , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscure . Dealing with the highest religious feelings of which human nature is susceptible , it never fades into indefiniteness , or is lost in the clouds . A calm , poised , convincing energy of argument is the writer 's characteristic . Every sentence is marked with the individual genuineness and originality of the meditation from which it springs . He works in no narrow space , upon the corners and angles of subjects ; he spins no attenuated threads , but leaves the tokens of an easy strength and a broad , massive handling on all his themes . We have in him the peculiar pleasure always received from a quiet , harmonious exercise of the complex faculties of reason , memory , fancy , and religious faith . He rarely emits sudden flashes of inspiration , but is ever warming into a steady glow . He rises seldom with quick flights to Himmaleh summits , but walks on a high table-land with a sustained evenness and force , in which // he has few companions . His sermons are models in the plainness of their views and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simple hread , and a pouring out of the water , of life . He has no ambition to get beyond the common truth , of which he is a herald , into any ingenuities of his own speculation ; yet , through all that is trite in the principles be urges , come forth fresh applications and moving appeals ; and we have felt continually , iii going through his book , how the wholesome and sufficing spiritual nourishment he affords never " puffs up , " hut only " builds up " the soul . Some may think his hook should not be called one of " Consolations , " it occupies so widely the field of Christian truth . But we think he has judged wisely in adapting so many topics to this one purpose . We wish it were more generally understood , . that the consolation of the afflicted does not consist merely in soothing words , or in sympathy , however sincere , expressed in modulations of the voice ; still less , in harrowing up the feelings by dwelling on the sad outward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all God 's inspiring and glorious truth to the spirit of man . For there is not a doctrine of his word , and not an attribute of his character , which , properly considered , is not consolatory . Nothing need he hid of the proportion of his revelation , but all displayed , to lead the sorrowing to the best resignation , to a clear cheerfulness and abiding peace . It is not merely smooth and quieting suggestions , as if we were hushing a child to sleep , or pleasing it with toys , that will give serenity and joy to the disappointed , the destitute , or the hereaved ; hut only a presenting of that divine reality on which they can depend , - that " substance of things hoped for , and evidence of things not seen , " which informs the mind , quickens faith , stirs the conscience , gives a zest to grief itself , and stimulates the whole spiritual nature to that morn distinct vision of a better world , from which the troubles of earth pass away unseen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some extracts , which , we hope , will lead our readers to the book from which they are derived . Take the following from the sermon on the need of the Father . " We feel , it seems to me , peculiar need of a Father in heaven , in our communion with the fair and glorious scenes of VOL . LxxII. - No. mi. 31 // nature . Did you ever see a little child taken by his father to see some glittering pageant , which seemed to the child immensely vast and grand ? And have you not marked how the child will at short intervals look away from the gay show to his father 's face , as if to fortify himself by a glance of love ? And , in these glances , does he not tacitly confess himself dazzled and bewildered by the sight , and able to look upon it only as supported by his father 's eye ? Not unlike emotions many of you must have felt , when you have sto6d by the ocean or on the mountain-top , or when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as at the commandment of the Holy One they stand in their order , and never faint in their watches . ' You have felt bewildered and lost , lonely and desolate ; you have been overwhelmed by a sense of vastness and immensity ; and a silent , shuddering awe has come over you . These emotions are the child 's yearning for the father 's eye . You feel thus , because you can not support the consciousness of solitude and desertion in the boundless universe . You can not bear to find yourself mere atoms in the outward creation , filling a smaller place in the great sum of being than a single leaf in the forest or a drop in the ocean , unless there be revealed to your distinct consciousness One who numbers the hairs of your heads and the sands of your lives . Were I an atheist , I would cut myself off from every grand view of nature , would shun the mountain and the ocean , and shut my eyes against the crimsoned sunset and the gemmed vault of night ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being I was , and how unsholtered ; - they would speak to me of a stupendous machinery beyond my control , of gigantic powers which 1 could not calculate , of material forces which my boasted intellect could neither comprehend nor modify . " pp. 5-7 . With what brief but striking expression is our Lord 's example of " Patience " portrayed ! " The Jew gives him over to the Gentile ; the Gentile bands him back , scourged and buffeted , to the Jew ; and the Jew again transfers him , lacerated and mangled , to the foreign executioner . * ut , beneath their jeers and taunts , tossed from one coarse hand to another in the crowd , grasping the mimic sceptre , with his temples torn by the thorns , he wears in his unmoved serenity a kingly aspect , which strikes admiration and awe into many rude hearts , and constrains the man of blood , who watches by the cross , to exclaim ,  --  ' Surely this was the Son of God . " ' p. 22 . The sermon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a thoughtful observer may thrill through the breast . // " I would first remark , that there is abundant reason to believe that memory never loses any thing , but that it retains , and may reproduce , when the right string is touched , every thought , impression , and event of our whole past lives . The well-ascertained phenomena of delirium , insanity , and other unusual forms of consciousness , furnish ample demonstration of this statement . In these conditions of mind , it has been found that the most minute and remote circumstances , complex trains of thought , series of words or musical notes , words even in an unknown tongue , have been recalled after an interval of years , and flooded the soul with its rememberings . In our usual state of mind , things do not indeed return to us uncalled , nor yet do they come at once when sought , but ohey certain laws of suggestion or association , which retard the action of the memory , as the balance-wheel does the movements of a watch . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is taken off , the usual laws of suggestion are suspended , the full flow of memory takes the place of the scanty jet of recollection , and the whole past rushes spontaneously upon the mind , foreshadowing the day when death will snap asunder the earth-spun threads of association , and pour the accumulated treasures of the past into the lap of the boundless future . " pp. 76 , 77 . " In seasons of sorrow , the past always utters its voices . At such times God brings every work into remembrance , and enters into judgment with our spirits . When the hand of Providence is heavy upon us , if the past has been stained with guilt , we need no inscription upon the wall to make our knees smite together and our souls tremble . The handwriting is upon the fleshly tablets of the heart ,  --  ' Thou art weighed in the balance and found wanting . ' There is nothing more true to universal experience than the self-reproaching communings of Joseph 's brethren , when they felt themselves surrounded hy imminent perils in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period for which they bad led self-complacent and generally dutiful lives , and rested on the one damning sin of former years ; and they said one to another , We are verily guilty concerning our brother , in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought us , and we would not hear ; therefore is this distress come upon us . ' A vast amount of remorse mingles with human grief , and drugs to the utmost with gall and wormwood the cup of sorrow . When ill-gotten and ill-used wealth departs , the remembrance of numberless breaches of good faith and charity arms penury with a scourge of scorpions , which she never wields when she enters the dwellings of God 's chosen ones . When the unfaithful and unloying are separated by death , with the sorrows of bereavement there // blend the embittering recollections of violated duty , variance , and discord . " pp. 79 , 80 . We must take a striking period from the sermon on the " Memory of Grief and Wrong . " " Take away , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sad aspect , - our mutual counsel and consolation in doubt or sorrow , our united prayers by the bedside , our last joint offices of piety over the dead , our intercessions for one another in the sanctuary , - there would be little left to unite us , little reason why we should worship and commune together , and we should fall asunder as isolated human units , each to feel out his own solitary way to the grave and to heaven . " pp. 340 , 341 . From the sermon on " The Communion of the Dead with the Living , " we take the closing passage . " To my mind there is hardly a text of Scripture , or form of speech , that rolls on with such a depth and fulness of meaning as those words , - Seeing that we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses . ' Vast and bewildering is the philosophical speculation which tells us that we can not lift a finger without moving the distant spheres . But far more grand and unspeakably solemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct in lowly and sheltered scenes , our speech and walk in the retirement of our homes , are felt through the universe of everliving souls , - that the laws of attraction and repulsion that reach through all orders of being , extend to our least words and deeds , - that in every worthy , generous , holy impulse , all heaven bears part , - that from the trail of our meanness and selfishness , our waywardness and levity , all heaven recoils . Let the august witnesses , the adoring multitude , in whose presence we dwell and worship , arouse us to growing diligence in duty , and awaken in us increasing fervor of spirit , that we may run with patience the race that is set before us , and , found faithful unto death , may receive the crown of life . " pp. 352 , 353 . We make no apology for the space which , among our secular topics , we have given to the notice of this truly religious volume , and to subjects suggested by it . In a purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful apparel , " apples of gold in pictures of silver , " it would deserve all commendation . But literature is an expression of life . And life is a scene whose glad experience so much disaster clouds , that if there be any steady light of comfort not subject to eclipse , // any heavenly brightness for the benighted soul of man , when the sun and stars of earthly hope are no longer seen , the blessed beams should be sent in every direction and reflected from every page . Unspeakably grateful are the many springs which God has opened to quench the thirst for knowledge . But how often , in anguish of mind or conscience , in sickness , grief , and the sbadow of death , is there a craving they all can not satisfy , and when they seem but as vinegar an dgall to parched lips . To every man must come the evil days , wherein is no mortal pleasure ; when tbe structure of the material world , from starry heights of immense space to subterraneous phenomena measuring inconceivable time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strange inscriptions , and wondrously preserved forms and hues of art , - will have no interest ; and when the changes and revolutions of the present , too , will go oy , like the earthquake men heeded not in the sore extremity of the battle . And when the tongues of this world thus lose their charm , and all its knowledge vanishes away in weakness and insufficiency , for nothing shall we render such thanks as for whatever suggestion has opened our ear to the voice of comfort and good cheer from above . The book that does this shall not fail of its honor . The whole benefit , which our author intends , can be received only from the study of connected pages in serious or sorrowful hours . We have occasion to know of the blessing at such seasons he has wrought . May his work proceed long and far in the effectual discharge of its kindly errand ! May it visit many an abode of anguish , be a welcome companion in chambers of sickness , and , in the mourner 's solitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as with an angel 's presence ! May the tears cease and dry up in many eyes that read it , and the groans no more be heard , or secret sighs heaved , from many bosoms that shall have pondered its lessons ! If the death-bed is cheered by it , and the grave illumined by the rays it reflects from heaven , its author 's desire will be fulfilled .
