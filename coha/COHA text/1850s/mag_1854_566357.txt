txt ART . JV. - BIBLE PREACHING . A Gamnpiete Analy8is of the Holy Bible , containing the whole of the Old and New 7ie8taments , collected and arranged 8y8-t*niafically . In Thirty Book8 , ( ba8ed on the work of the learned lialbot . ) Together with an Introduction , setting forth the Work , and the inunense facility this method affords for understanding the Word of God . Also , . three different Tables of Contents , prefixed ; and a General Index , subjoined , so elaborated , and arranged in alphabetical order , as to direct at once to any subject required . By Rev. NATHANIEL WEST , ID . ID . New York : Charles Scribner , 145 Nassau street , 1853 . THE remark , " Give us more Bible preachin* " is so often made , that we are induced to expand into a brief article what was originally intended only as a notice of this work of Dr. West . We have a few thoughts , suggested by it , to lay before our readers , which , if not new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention . They are appropriate , in speaking of a Scripture analysis like the one before us , since it is a leading design , as we suppose , of such a work , to put it in the power of preachers to infuse the Bible element into their pulpit ministrations to any desirable extent . We are not surprised to hear the desire expressed for a more scriptural style of preaching . There is , clearly , a reason for it . There are peculiarities and deficiencies in our pulpit discourses which are much to be regretted . They have attracted the attention of Christians . They have inspired extensively the conviction , that , in many sermons , the scriptural element is either wholly wanting , or not enough prominent . Whatever other excellencies remain , the absence of this is fatal . The popular // Christian heart can not forgive it , but instinctively cries out for its restoration . In these circumstances , it is well to inquire concerning the peculiarities and deficiencies here adverted to . What are some of them , and whence do they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were the Saviour now present in the flesh , the Temple scene would often be r&amp;nacted in many a Christian sanctuary . He who would not tolerate brokers and traflicers who profaned the sacred precincts of his Father 's house , whose righteous indignation impelled him to drive them , amid rebukes and scourges , from the hallowed court of the Temple , would be scarcely less moved , were he to enter one of our fancy congregations , and listen to the prayers and preaching of its fancy minister . " Make not my Father 's house a house of merchandise , " would be , we think , the mildest rebuke that could be uttered . Make it not a den of thieves , could hardly be deemed too severe . Doubtless , indeed , people and preacher share in the guilt of what we are holding up to censure . They mutually influence each other . But we are at present only concerned with the misconduct , in the matter before us , of the preacher , so far as it is chargeable *ipon him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose peculiarities and deficiencies extort from pious people the cry , " Give us more Bible preaching . " We have spoken of fancy preachers . By this term we designate those who aim to be fashionable preachers ; who seem to court applause and congregations ; who confound preaching with poetry ; imagination and fancy with inspiration ; beauty of imagery with beauty of character ; extravagance with excellence ; or oddity with originality . What would the Master say to one of his ambassadors who seemed to forget the Cross , in his eagerness to draw a crowd , or to be more solicitous to pray and preach beautifully than effectually ? Is there , can there be any question , that sucfm a preacher has lost , or never exhibited , the Bible element in preaching ? Surely , if any of his hearers desired the " sincere milk of the Word , " they might look up , indeed , but would not be fed . And what would the Master say to hini who has confounded the sermon with the religious essay ? Cold precision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the essay , are worthless in a sermon , unless there be superadded the spiritual fervor and point of one who is earnest to persuade sinriers to be reconciled to God . They may edify the cultivated portion of the assembly* but they will miev er awaken the inquiry , " What shall we do to be saved ? " Another preacher has somehow conceived the idea that li* is richly endowed with // metaphysical acumen , and so must exercise his gift with each returning Sabbath . Accordingly , he selects a text , just as a diver would select a place to plunge into the stream , and goes down at the text , out of the sight of his auditory , emerging again only at the place to say amen . ' ' Another is given to smooth homilies , which disturb no consciences , and only suffice to make his preaching " like a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice , and can play well upon an instrument . " Nor are these the only examples which may be taken to represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministrations do not meet the religious wants of the people . There is another class which we are tempted to call , though we mean not any unkindness , religions croakers . This class of individuals , which is somewhat numerous in the brotherhood has its representatives in the pulpit . Their sermons are perfect Jeremiads , Biblical only so far as this . The last heresy is more frequently the theme than the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ ; the last development of ecclesiastical or moral depravity , than the compassion of an atoning Saviour . Fear is predominant in their minds . Faith has lost sight of the Almighty One who has promised to overrule the wrath of nian , and the . reinainder to restrain . In the weakness of their faith or ( what we are less willing to believe ) in the unamiableness of their temper , or else in their ambition to secure the reputation of being guardians of orthodoxy , they forsake the Bible , mistaking the true method of drawing others toward it . Their preachin* is querulous and repulsive , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heresy-hunting spirit . It is unamiable , undirected to the great end of saving souls , and , therefore , unprofitable . For , essential as the purity of the Gospel is to its power , and great as nmay be the evil of heresy-certainly it is great enough-there is " a more excellent way " of putting an end to this evil , of arresting its progress , and of enlightening , rescuing , blessing those who have been taken in its snare . The furious assault , iterated and reiterated with every returning Sabbath , the assault , which seems intended rather to kill the heretics than the heresy , if it be at all consistent with the idea of Bible preaching , certainly is not its most felicitous model . Nor can we regard , as fully realizing this idea , the mere religions harangue . Not a few , especially of those who preach without notes , fall into this method unconsciously to themselves . Their preaching is chiefly hortatory . They portray the alarms and allurements uf the Gospel abundantly ; we were ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , toward which every persuasion should impel both the sinner and the saint , is // not enough portrayed , not enough prominent . There is , indeed , no design to conceal it . On the contrary , the preacher may be sincere , and earnest to do good , and may often speak of Christ in his tine character , as a redeeming Saviour . The defect results from his failure to consider , that mere exhortation is not the whole of pulpit duty , and , indeed , will lose half its power , if the whole Bible be not searched for its principles and truths , as well as for the duties it en*joins . There is yet another class of ministers who are not , we think , entitled to the credit of realizing the loftiest ideal of Bible preaching , although none so earnest as they . They are not timid , but bold as a lion . They are not despondent through the feebleness of their faith : on the contrary , they arefull of faith , faith in certain ideas of progress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ r , . elatve importance is matter of endless debate . By these ideas they are so pervaded , that all their intellectual and religious exercises revolve about them . All their religions experience is moulded by them . Even their estimate of others is formed from them . lEn short , they are technical reformers . Sincere in their philanthropy , enthusiastic in their temperament , and inspired with a*. keen sense of the evils they combat , few are so abundant in labors to promote their favorite reforms . What we allege , respecting them , is , that they do not fully rise to the idea of *I3ible preaching , because , though , perchance , in preaching the obligations of humanity and righteousness , they preach the Go&amp;pel , yet , in restricting their pulpit addresses to their favorite ideas , they do not preach the whole Gospel . Nor do they realize the highest , best idea of pulpit power . It is equally true , that they worse than waste not a little breath in unamiable rebukes of those who have allied themselves more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intending to neglect these . And , indeed , of this latter class it should be said , that they often fall into equal , perhaps greater and guiltier neglect , to wit , by overlooking almost entirely the ideas which those , whom we have just considered , make too exclusively prominent . Such are some of the classes in the ministry , whose preaching is variously marked by peculiarities and defects , incompatible with our idea of Bible preaching . In response to the inquiry whence arises so wide a departure from the true standard of pulpit address , it is enough to say , that it can be explained only as we suppose the Bible itself to have been more or less neglected by the individuals in question . It is incredible that they habitually read and study it , bathe their souls daily in its spirit , and so make familiar its beautiful // forms of imagery , thought , feeling , and devotion . It is incredible that they come by this means into daily contact with the Saviour in his example and teachings . Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cherish more those holy influences which would gnide them to a clear apprehension of His divine character and mission , this evil could scarcely exist . They would not so lose sight of one whose great commission they bear , would not pass beyond His felt attractions , and illustrate painfully , by their earthly ambition , the expulsive power of a new affection ; in short , would not lose their own personal interest in the Bible , and then assume that others in like manner have lost theirs . The Bible element would more enter and pervade , not only their hearts and lives , but their pulpit ministrations as well . We pass now to inquire what the true idea of Scriptural preaching is ? John Wesley , the pious and sagacious founder of the Wesleyan Methodists , was accustomed to charge his circuit preachers thus : " Observe , it is not your business to preach so many times , and to take care merely of this and that society ; but to save as many souls as you can ; to bring as many sinners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your power to build them up in that holiness without which they can not see the Lord . " Plainly the author of these instructions deemed the salvation of the unconverted , the bringing of sinners to repentance , and the building of them up in ho mess , as central ideas of gospel preaching . " The most effective preaching , " says another eminent divine , " is that which springs from the experimental piety of the minister , from the deep and practical working of religion upon his own heart . He can not declare the whole counsel of God , who has not walked with God , and held communion with him on the mount of prayer . He can not truly preach Christ and him crucified , in whose heart Christ has not been formed the hope of glory , and whose life is not hid with Christ in God . He may give the shape and form of truth , but it will be a cold and lifeless carcass of theology ; something within is wanting ,  --  the beating heart , the heaving breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The minister must achieve one half of his work in his closet , ' not at his desk and among his books , but upon his knees , at the throne of grace . Then will he go out to his people , as Moses came down from the Mount , with a face shining with communion with God , and he will reflect the brightness of his piety throughout the camp of his own spiritual Israel . Such preaching can not but be eloquent : it is eloquent with love , with grace , with holiness , with truth-an eloquence // that does not , like the aurora borealis , flash its coruscating fire in the sky , while a polar winter reigns below ; but rather , like the sun , warms and vivifies the world beneath , while , at the same time , it gilds and glorifies the heavens . " There is no essential difference between the ideas of this divine , relative to the true idea of Bible preaching , and those of John Wesley . In the view of both , " Christ and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the conversion and sanctification of souls its great end . In the view of both , communion , and a close walk with God , are essential prerequisites to pulpit power . And why ? Clearly because these are indispensable to secure that infusion of the Biblical spiritual element into a discourse , which alone can render it a fit message from God to redeemed sinners . Who , indeed , has not appreciated the justness of Garrick 's reply , when asked , by a clergyman , why the people listened to preaching with such indifference , while so absorbed and transported by the exhibitions of the stage ? " We represent fiction , " said he , " as if it were truth , and you exhibit truth as if it were fiction . " This criticism of the great tragedian relates , indeed , to the manner of pulpit addresses , rather than to their subject matter . Both , however , enter into the ideal of a Bible preacher . The Bible must supply his themes and thoughts . Christ and him crucified must be his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone essential to a model sermon ? Are numerous quotings of Scripture , as the manner of some is , alone essential ? Are speculations , radiating from some passage of the sacred writers , be they ever so ingenious , fresh , original ,  --  be they ever so brilliant and fervid ? Alas ! they are , after all , but speculations . They are perceived to be nothing more . They are not bread of life to hungry souls . On the contrary , the ideal of Bible preaching is realized only when the truths of the Bible supply the matter , and the spirit of the Bible inspires the manner of the man ; only when habitual study and meditation have stored the memory with treasures of Biblical knowledge , and the heart with the Biblical spirit . When the heart of the preacher is full of the Bible , the spirit , and the letter , out of its abundance his mouth will speak . His diction , imagery , illustrations , thoughts , mode of argument , and appeal will take direction , take hue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He will be an earnest man ; they were so . Ifle will deal plainly with the consciences of his auditors ,  --  show God 's people their transgressions , and warn wicked men ; they did so . He will not preach himself , nor anybody else , but Christ Jesus the Lord . He will teach the things which concern the Lord Jesus , for so did the // holy men , who spake and wrote as they were moved by the Holy Ghost . He will wisely proportion and balance the allurements and the alarms of the Bible , as they have done ; will catch their spirit of philanthropy , as they caught that of the Saviour , and will be inspired by it ; in short , will make them , indeed the Master himself , his model , the Master 's teachings his guide . Of course , in exhibiting what we take to be the true idea of preaching , we are not at liberty to pass by such eminent models , especially the Great Preacher himself . Can any one read the sermon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvements on the Great Master , by a portion of the sacred pro ? bssion ? Can any one read the devout , earnest , impassioned , heroic discourses of Peter and Paul , the no less earnest , honest , plain-spoken appeals , contained in the letters of these apostles to the churches , or in those of James , and of the beloved disciple , and not blush at specimens of religious appeal now too often heard from successors of the apostles , both in and out of the Episcopal church ? We commend the attentive study of these great models to all ministers who find themselves tempted to become fashionable preachers , afraid to speak of penal fire for fear of shocking ears politer than those of the S aviour , afraid to press the obligations of temperance , humanity , and strict business integrity , for fear of the sour looks of men who keep their principles as truly in market as their merchandise . We fully believe that were our preachers of the gospel to draw their philosophy , theology , and piety more directly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German speculations , nor alone from theological teachers and text-books , nor from consulting what will be congenial to the tastes of worldly arishioners , we should hear less often the cry , " give us more ible preac mug . The pulpit would exert a more commanding influence , because its incumbents would fall naturally and felicitously into the true mode of pulpit address . Our remaining inquiry relates to the importance of this type of preaching ; we mean Bible preaching , as distinguished from the " fancy performances ' * which , in our large cities , have turned the fashionable world upside down , performances which , in common parlance , we should design ate pulpit " ciaytrc*p , " rather than preaching ; as distinguished too from the elegant religious essay , from the dry metaphysical discussion , the religious speculation , and the mere religious harangue . We shall not discuss this point at any length . It is quite too obvious . And yet there is a thought or two connected with it well worthy to be pondered . The first is , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its respectability in the eye of real Christians ought to be , and is , to a great extent , lost . It sinks into a sort of stage , preaching into a mere performance , and public worship into a fashionable entertainment , quite endurable , forsooth , for half a day , especially where one will probably hear a " be*utifn1 " sermon . Possibly it may achieve a degree of popularity in certain places , and crowds run after it . It may possess a high artistic merit , glitter with brilliant flights of imagination , sparkle with vivid , glowing imagery , and description . Thus it may please just as a statue or a painting would please a lover of art , just as a landscape or a flower would please a lover of nature . But who can truly respect a preacher who has forgotten his great commission , or turned aside from its plain instructions ? Take from preaching the Bible element , and how have you degraded and debased it ! How have you stripped the preacher of his elevation as an ambassador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to the level of the forum or the Senate Hall ! If he draw crowds to the san*ctuary , it is for the same reason that eminent orators , or actors , draw crowds to the Senate Chamber or to the theatre . His eloquence is artistic eloquence , rather than sacred . lie is an orator , rather than a preacher of righteous ness , a performer , rather than a herald of the skies . The importance of Bible preaching is again apparent , when it is considered that these departures from it not only degrade the ministry , but divest them of their appropriate power . The power of a truly Bible preacher is immense . Princes and potentates like Felix tremble before it . But this power lies not in his transcendent ability , his logic , his fancy , his grace of manner , or melody and modulation of voice , but in tho fact that he comes from the Great King , and deals seriously with matters of infinite moment . The appropriate power of the pulpit is its power to save sinners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to persuade men to break off their iniquities and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ , its power again to build up believers in the doctrines , faith , and duties of the Gospel . Plainly , then , the preacher no sooner departs from his true type and ideal , than he loses all spiritual conimunication with the people . He may retain an intellectual communication with his auditory , but a spiritual lie can not . This is not mere opinion , muere conjecture , but a conviction and reality , demonstrated by a thousand examples patent to the observation of every one . We have tried all kinds of preaching . Every local church , that has any history , has tried them , tried the shadow and the substance , the formal homily and the fervent // Bible appeal , the philosophical dissertation , and the practical development of doctrines and duties , the dry , cold , didactic , technical sermon , and the earnest unfolding of the Scriptures to show to the people the things of Christ . We have 8een this trial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have seen what a pitiful substitute is any preaching , which has lost the Bible element , for that by which " it has pleased God to save them that believe . " Every other fails of its great end , fails consciously to the preacher , and no less consciously to the people . What see we not of the mischievous consequences of false methods of exhibiting the riches of Christ ? Has the pulpit that powerful hold of the popular heart which it has had in some periods of the history of the church , and which it may yet regain ? Why has it lost this hold ? Not for want of talent , nor of erudition , nor of industry , nor of intellectual merit in its addresses ; not alone because it is not leading the van in reformatory movements , since the zeal of not a few preachers goes in these movenients quite up to what is written , while no doubt not a few are plethoric with ultra conservatism . Why , then , has it lost , in no small measure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has it giveii them the ancient malady which Paul designates by the term " itching ears Why has it converted many a sanctuary into a kind of Sabbath opera-house , a choir to entertain the assembly at one end , and a preacher at the other ? Is not this the explanation , that it has almost entirely let go the sacred , touching associations connected with the Bible ; forsaken its treasures of moral beauty , and of literary as well ; sought to rise above the magniilcent conceptions and imagery of inspiration , and so fallen immeasurably below ; s9ught to add intensity to God 's appeals . and so weakened them ; aspired to a purer , better model of style than is found in the Bible , and so produced one in - comparably inferior ? Is it not , in short , because of a departure from the true ideal of Bible preaching , and an effort to substitute something else in its place ? If it were at all needful to discuss , at greater length , the importance of this type of pulpit ministration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from a glance at the sad consequences of a want of the Bible element , we would refer our readers to the achievements which this type of preaching has won , whenever and wherever it has appeared . Trace the triumphs of Christianity in the early centuries . The labors of the apostles illustrate the importance of the kind of preaching which we commend . Trace the triumphs of Protestantism in // Wickliffe 's time , in Luther 's time , and you find that they have been achieved by men inspired with the spirit of the sacred word , Bible preachers , over men whose type of Christianity was that of fashion and form . And whenever IRomanism has powerfully reacted , and borne back the tide of Reformed doctrine , as in the days of Ignatius Loyola , it has been because , as iMlacaulay says , " danger called forth in the bosom of the church of Rome many of the highest qualities of the Reformers ; " while , on the other hand , " the Reformed churches had contracted some of the corruptions which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ha*1 become lukewarm and worldly . " The *pirit of the Bible had left the hearts , and consequently the sermons of the champions of the Protestant faith . It had gone , in some measure , into the hearts and labors of the Catholic priesthood. ilence the tide turned . Thus it is that history strikingly illustrates the importance of Bible preaching . Its voice sends the minister to the Bible for the elements of his power and usefulness , as truly , not to say as impressively , as the voice of conscience itself But enough . We regard the book of Dr. West , whose title page has been placed at the head of this Article , as one which may be essentially serviceable to the preacher in his effort to catch the full inspiration of the sacred word , and to infuse into his pulpit-labors , both its letter and spirit . There are furnished him by the completeness of this Analysis , and its copious indices , facilities for learning all that God has spoken in relation to his theme , all , indeed , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christian life . We believe this work well fitted , as certainly it is intended , to facilitate the study of the Bible by topics , one of the most useful modes of studying it . It is equally fitted and intended to inspire a new interest in the sacred volume ; and thus , we earnestly hope , will achieve somewhat toward a recall of unfaithful ministers to the true idea of Bible preaching .
