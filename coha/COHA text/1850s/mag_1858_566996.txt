ART . XI. - DR . THOMPSON 'S MEMOIR OF STODDARD . . Afie ? noir of Rev. David Tappan Stoddard , Missionary to the Nestorians , by JOSEPH P. THOMPSON , ID . ID. , Pastor of the Broadway Tabernacle Church . New York : Sheldon , Blakeman &amp; Co. 1858. pp. 422 . Oun English and American literature is rich , perhaps we hazard nothing in saying , richer than any other , in the department of Christian biography ; and no class of books have ministered more directly , or largely , to the church , in the nurture of her sons , than this . We are inclined to believe that there is hardly any one among our clergy who can not attribute to this source some of the most lasting and powerful impulses , if not the very earliest , to a Christian life . Dr. Thompson introduces his Memoir of Stoddard , by a happy and appropriate quotation from Tholuck 's Sonntags Bibliotheic , in which , after bewailing the poverty of their German literature in biographical works , in comparison with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , even among them , more awakenings have been caused by the written lives of men eminent for piety , than by sermons and books of devotion ,  --  that he is able to mention numbers from the circle of hiss own acquaintance , and among them names of the first rank in the religions world , who are thus indebted ; and for himself he testifies , in common with not a few in Europe , America and Asia , that the biography of Henry Martyn " opened in his own life a new era of religious progress . " What eminent names are already enrolled upon the missionary biography of the church , many of them familiar as household words , their memoirs lying upon the tables of the affluent , and still more frequently found beside the Bible and hymn book , in the chambers of invalids , and the dwellings of the poor ! What memories cluster around such names as Brainerd , Martyn , Buchanan , Ifeber , Carey , Morrison , Judson ! It would seem almost possible to // write the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , that the very splendor of these names creates a difficulty ; and in the abundance of such memoirs , the impression prevails that unless there be something romantic in the way of thrilling incident , or unless the missionary has interwoven his work with the progress of science , or imbedded it in political change , there is no sufficient reason for adding to the number of our biographies . Yet here , it must be confessed , we have a biography which comprises no events of novel interest , or startling power , and yet one of serene beauty , and abiding value . David Tappan Stoddard was born in Northampton , Mass. , in 1818 , of pious parents , and an ancestry long and honorably distinguished in the service of the Christian Church . He was descended from the eminent pastor of Northampton , Rev. Solomon Stoddard , whose name is closely associated with that of his grandson and colleague , the immortal Edwards , and who gave name to certain controverted views upon the terms of communion , known in the last century as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1838 , and after spending a year at Andover , completed his theological studies at New Haven , and entered upon the Christian ministry in the spring of 1842 . It serves to show the nature of the prejudices that had been excited against the New Haven Seminary , that Mr. Stoddard , appearing before an association of Congregational ministers , in western Massachusetts , from this institution , could hardly obtain licensure . After protracted discussions over the sentiments he professed on the subjects of Regeneration and Total Depravity , he was licensed , but was told that he was heretical on some points , yet , as he was a young man , it was to be hoped he would live to repent . Mr. Stoddard 's whole life and character , as it proved him sound upon the subj ect of Christianity in general , proved him especially so on these two cardinal doctrines ; and the decision of these ministers is but another of those evidences of which the history of the Church is full , that clergymen , when contending with one another over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by their recorded decis // ions expose themselves to the ridicule and pity of after generations . Mr. Stoddard 's religious character , confessedly a remarkable one even among missionary circles , was characterized by the depth of his sense of sin , and the thoroughness with which the grace of regeneration wrought in every department and manifestation of his character . It is instructive as an illustration of theological partisanship , that Christian men should solemnly declare views of sin and regeneration to be heretical , which wrought in Mr. Stoddard a character everywhere known and accepted , as a beautiful development of Christian depth and fervor . Soon after he began to preach , Mr. Stoddard decided to devote himself to the missionary work ; indeed , this purpose had been growing in him from the first . The knowledge that his mother had often expressed the hope that he would become a missionary , pre-disposed his mind to thonghtfuluess and prayer , as soon as he had consecrated himself to his Redeemer 's service ; and a few weeks after his first communion , he wrote to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Board , that the result of his investigation was " a firm conviction , that duty will summon me , at a future day , to give up friends and country , and spend my life in a foreign land . I now want only the approval of my family to make the decision as final as a prospective view of several years will allow . " This was in the spring of 1836 , and in the autumn of 1842 , he met with Rev. Dr. Perkins , then on a visit to this country from Oroomiah , and as the result of his communication with that excellent missionary , he decided , to the growing joy of his whole after life , to give himself to the work of God among the Nestorians . This interesting people are now so well known to the Christian public , in part by the visit of lifar Yokannan to this country , but still more by the extensive and manifestly genuine revivals , which have taken place among them , that our readers probably have a pretty accurate conception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most romantic mission in connection with the Board . Their history is a long and luminous one , dating back to the middle of the fifth century , and // taking its rise out of one of those fierce theological contentions to which clerical ambition ministered fuel , rather than zeal for a true Christianity . They awaken the sympathy of the Protestant mind , at the start , as victims of persecution , and they constrain the homage of our admiration for centuries , as a Missionary Church spreading the triumphs of the Gospel over Central Asia , and Eastward to the shores of China . But this great communion , surpassing , at the flood , the spread of tither the Latin or the Greek Church , has now retreated into the mountain fastnesses of Persia , and is " the least among the thousands of Judah . " They have been called by Dr. Perkins , The Protestants of Asia , for rejecting many of the corruptions of the Eastern churches , such as image-worship , auricular confession , the doctrine of purgatory , and for exalting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied by this remnant of the Kestorian Church , the plain of Oroonilah and the adj acent hights of the Koordish mountains , is a country peculiar in its features , and as singularly beautiful . We can not deny to our readers Mr. Stoddard 's description , contained in a letter to Prof. Olmsted , written from Seir , a mountain village , overlooking the plain and city of Oroomiah . " The village of Seir is in the province of Oroomiah , in northern Persia , in latitude 3 ' 7O 28 ' 18 " north , and in approximate longitude 450 east from Greenwich . We are about forty miles from the boundary of Turkey , and one hundred and fifty from that of Russia . The village is on the grassy slope of the mountain , which rises 2,834 feet above the neighboring city of Oroomiah , and 7,334 above the ocean . The side of the mountain on which we live faces the northeast , and is consequently somewhat bleak in winter . The snow also lies upon it in the spring long after it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Seir we look down on the very beautiful and extensive plain of Oroomiab , forty miles in length , and from twelve to twenty miles in breadth , which possesses a deep alluvial soil , and bears on its fertile bosom several hundred villages . The city of Oroomiab , the ancient Thebarma , situated near the centre of the plain , as well as many of the villages , is surrounded by innumerable gardens and orchards , and rows of poplars , willows , and sycamores , which make large portions of the plain resemble a continued forest . The mountains of Koordistan encircle the plain on three sides , while to the east lies the lake of Oroomiah , studded with islands , and reflecting the pure azure of an Itallan sky . " This plain is watered by three rivers of moderate size , which come down from the Koordish mountains , and are distributed by a network of small canals and water-courses over its whole surface . Without artificial irrigation , but few crops // can be brought to maturity , although here and there wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are wholly dependent on the rains of the spring and early summer , and sometimes yield a tolerable harvest . " The principal productions of the plain of Oroomiab , the annual mean temperature of which is , of course , considerably above that of Seir , are wheat , barley , corn , millet , flax , tobacco , rice , cotton , castor oil , apples , pears , plums , grapes , ( which are cultivated in immense vineyards , ) cherries , apricots , nectarines , peaches , melons , pomegranates , almonds , and the jujube . The fig , with care , may be also cultivated , but is often destroyed by the cold of winter . " The lake of Oroomiah , the ancient Spautes , is about ninety miles long by thirty broad . Its elevation above the ocean is 4,100 feet . Its water has been analyzed by President Hitchcock ; its specific gravity is 11.55 . The lake exerts , of course , a marked influence on the climate of this region , and produces a regular land and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a light wind blows from the lake , and during the night a fresher wind from the lofty mountains of Koordistan , which rise , some forty miles west of the lake , to a hight of ten or twelve , or perhaps thirteen thousand feet above the ocean , and generally retain on their summits , even in summer , deep masses of snow . The amount of watery vapor is thus probably much greater in Oroomiah than in many parts of Persia , which present almost the barrenness of the Arabian deserts . " It should be mentioned in this connection , that all the mountains of northern Persia are destitute of trees , and many of them rise to a great hight , in naked , rocky summits . Indeed , in the valleys and on the plains it is rare to find any trees except those planted by the hand of man , and a stranger , as he looks down on the luxuriant plain of Oroomiab , can hardly be made to believe that the millions of trees before him are entirely an artificial growth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attractive even by nature , but rendered delightful beyond comparison , by the works of grace which made the Kestorian mission an outpost of heaven . His reception by the people was a fit introduction to the useful and happy life Providence was reserving for him . In his first letter to his " beloved parents , " dated June , 1843 , he writes of it thus : " Monday we rose just after midnight , to avoid the heat of the noon-day sun . Our ride lay through a long straight avenue of four miles , planted with trees much of the way , and looking very beautifully by the light of a full moon . Leaving this avenue we crossed a fine bridge of brick arches , and gradually wound up a series of hills for half a dozen miles . Then we stopped to take a lunch ; and spreading on the ground our thin native bread with this and boiled tongue , and cheese and eggs , we made a very comfortable meal . Crossing a low ridge of mountains , we came in sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what feelings of joy we welcomed it , as it lay peacefully stretched out at our feet . At eight , our ride was over and we pitched our tents near the northwestern corner of the lake on the plain of Salinas . Under us was soft green grass , and over our heads trees , ( unlike any kind we see at home , ) the blossoms of which perfumed // 879 the air . We received from a neighboring village , fresh milk , yagourd and bread , and stretching ourselves on our cloaks , with our saddles for a pillow , were soon in the land of forgetfulness . It was a pleasant day , and our hearts beat high in the prospect of the next day reaching Gavalan and meeting our Oroomiah friends . The bishop left us some days before , anxious to reach his home , and prepare for us a fat lamb from his father 's flock . The next morning we started again very early and were at Gavalan by breakfast time . As we approached the village , five or six on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iloshe geldiz , hoshe geldiz , ' ( you have come welcome . ) They proved to be friends from the mission , whose names were familiar to us all-Priest Abraham , Joseph , Mar Yohannan 's brother , John and Moses . On entering the village , men , women , and children poured out to join and welcome our party . We were escorted as if in a triumphal procession through the town to the house of Mar Yohannan 's father . The old couple were oveijoyed ; said that they were made some years younger by their son 's return , and that they praised God for his goodness . Soon Mar Joseph , an old bishop with a silver beard , and half a dozen priests from Oroomiah , came in with their Salam aleykim , Salam aleykim-peace-peace be to you . Our tents were erected in the old priest 's garden , and during the day c were thronged with visitors . My heart was full . I was not prepared for such a welcome-such a hearty grasp of the hand-such an overflowing of cordial feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributed to their natural good feeling-some to their personal attachments  --  and perhaps some to the privileges which they hope to derive from a connection with us . But after all I must believe that God has opened their hearts to receive the Gospel in the love of it , and that they welcome us as the ambassadors of Christ . I bless my Father for the prospect of usefulness that opens upon us . I rejoice that I am here-just where I am-here to live , and I trust , here to die . Soon may we have revivals of religion among the people , and see them not only right in theory , but cordial believers in Jesus . " We can not even begin our account of Mr. Stoddard 's missionary labors among the Nestorians , without alluding to his love of science , aud his devotion especially to astronomy . us name is associated at Yale in the minds of many of his fellow students , with the construction of a telescope ; and we doubt not that the mention of this fact will recall his slender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some who knew him chiefly as the student who had constructed with his own hands an instrument whereby to prosecute his astronomnical pursuits . Prof. Olmsted gave him the privileges of an a*-*i8tant , so that he had access at all times , to the College Observatory and the philosophical instruments , and was allowed to take observations with an experienced and careful man . Prof. Sillimnan , also , admitted him to his laboratory and library , and proffered him any assistance he might desire . In the town too , // he had the use of an able machinist 's tools ; and with these helps he made , at his leisure , a telescope of five and a half inches apertnre , and six feet focal length , intended to magnify from two to four hundred times . His biographer informs us that Mr. Stoddard at this time occupied a room directly under his own , which he converted into a machine , shop , and at every interval of the class recitations , he was at work grinding his mirrors or framing his tubes , and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of speemlum . This telescope he took with him to Oroomiah , and the first thing we meet with in his correspondence is the good use to which he put this instrument of science , in gaining an influence for himself and his missionary work over intelligent Persians . He was at first deeply impressed with the general influence , exerted by the missionaries , in softening prejudices , impressing respect for European manners and civilization , and so preparing the way for the Gospel among the Mussulmen . Shortly after his arrival in Oroomiali , he gives the following interesting narration to his honored instructor , Prof. Olmsted . " ORoOMIAR , August 14th , 1843 . " My DEAR SIR-I have recently been reminded of you in a most interesting way . When I was in America , I was in doubt whether it was best to bring my telescope , as it is difficult and expensive to transport such instruments over the lofty mountains of Turkey . But Mr. Perkins advised me by all means to keep it with me , as everything of the kind would contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of science , and even of religion . I followed his advice ; and several weeks since , on unpacking it , was rejoiced to find it in perfect order . It very soon attracted much attention , and was thought by the natives to be a large and beautiful top. * When the menajim bashee , the chief astrologer , heard about the instrument , he came without delay to pay me a visit . He is a very intelligent man , perhaps the most so , excepting the prince , of any one I have seen in Persia . His father before him was also eminent in this country for his skill in the same profession . Though perfectly acquainted with our system of astronomy , his religion and his early prejudices incline him to that of Ptolemy . Perhaps as received here , it has undergone slight modifications , but in its essential features it is the same as of old . The menajim seems also to have studied the books of India , which , if I mistake not , imply the rotundity of the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he knows perfectly well that a change of place , east or west , will produce a change in the meridian , and that the pole is elevated as one travels to the north . I think he would be willing to admit our system in full , were it not // Dr. li7wrnp8on 's ilemoir of Stoddard. 881 for his religion , and his dislike to new notions , ' for he can not raise a sound objection against it . He has tables handed down for many years , which enable him to calculate eclipses and other celestial phenomena with considerable accuracy . Every year he is in the habit of making out his Persian almanac , copies of which he presents to distinguished men . I mentioned , in our conversation , the great solar eclipse of December . He at once produced his books , and said that I was correct in the time , but that the eclipse would be invisible at Oroomiah . According to our tables , I replied , it can be seen throughout Asia . He smiled pleasantly , and answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As he was anxious to know what we made the exact time of the beginning and ending of the eclipse , and the number of digits obscured , I promised , at my leisure , to calculate it for him I have partly done so , and if I have made no error , the sun will at this place rise in eclipse and continue thus some time ; six or seven hundred miles south of us the eclipse will be total . " I am not aware that the menajim bashee has uny instruments , except a small crazy spy-glass , and a brass circle for measuring angles , graduated to halg or * sibly to quarter degrees . His knowledge , however , of the constellations , an dmotions of the heavenly bodies , is full and minute . We are spending the summer at Seir , and as our elevation is six or seven hundred feet above the plain , a fine opportunity is afforded for observation . The sky is always beautifully clear , and our ordinary nights would be called in America remarkably fine . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sooner was it dark than he wished to use the telescope . I first pointed it at Saturn , which was near its culmination ; at the first glance , the menajim bashee declared that he saw neither satellites nor rings . At this I was , of course , not at all disappointed , and asked him to have a little patience and he would have his curiosity gratified . After a little , he obtained a good focus , and saw the ring . This almost made him leap for joy . He looked again and again , and delighted me by his enthusiasm . Presently he exclaimed that he had a distinct view of the division in the ring , and one of the sat . ellites . That night three or four were visible , but it was not strange that a novice should be unable to detect them . I had , however , a keen-eyed companion ; for though disposed to make every objection , and admit nothing on testimony , he was satisfied that he saw the division in the ring and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is a record , many years old , in their possession , which states that Saturn was once seen in the shape of an almond ; but that they know nothing of any rings or any satellites belonging to it . " We now turned to Jupiter ; and he was lost in astonishment . There were its four moons , and several broad belts crossing the disc of the planet-all too plain to admit of a doubt . Looking up to me , the astrologer earnestly said ; Tell me anything you please about these moons , and I will accept it . ' You will readily believe I was exceedingly gratified . We next looked at Mars ; the gibbous state of which he readily admitted . It was too near the horizon to be seen to advantage ; yet s6me of the dark spots on its surface were discernible . " In different views of the Milky Way he was less interested , because , he said , their books declared it to be composed of stars . He seemed gratified by the clu8. tar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The menajim wanted much to have a sight of HerscheL ; he was half incredu. // Dr. Tho ? np8on*s . Afe*moir of Stoddard . INov. , ions about the existence of any such planet , especially as I did not know its place in the heavens . I had not by me , as I now have , the American Almanac . I promised to look it up for him , and show it to him on a subsequent visit ; but I fear the telescope is hardly powerful enough to gratify him . " At a late hour we retired to rest , promising ourselves the pleasure of seeing Jupiter and Venus the next morning . As soon as the menajim cast his eyes on Jupiter , he could hardly contain himself . One of the satellites was on the other side of the planet , and all had changed their positions . Jupiter then has moons , ' said he , and they revolve around him-you are certainly in the right . ' " Venus , like Mars , was near the horizon , and besides was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising , and though they do not hinder observations to any great hights , almost obscure that part of the horizon . Mercury I did not try to find . Indeed , as it was much nearer the sun than Venus , I would not have found it if I could . " After sunrise the menajim retired , apparently much gratified , and promising to come again . He is a real enthusiast , and , I doubt not , he will take as much of my time as I can spare . However , as he is a man of much influence , time spent with him is by no means lost . Our great engrossing business ought to be the salvation of these dying men ; but if indirectly , we can stimulate the Mussulmans to thought and inquiry , or give them new views in science , one great advance towards their conversion will be made . They already look up to Europeans as men of talent and noble acquisitions-God grant that this may prepare the way for the hearty reception of the Gospel . " Astrology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with the Mussulman traditions , which they hardly esteem as of less authority , that whatever seems to weaken or destroy the former , sweeps away with it the latter . In this view we must hail among this people the progress of the sciences , especially of that one which may not inaptly be called a pillar of their f*mith . I have no time , dear Sir , to write more . " Bat the great feature in Mr. Stoddard 's missionary life , as in that of the mission to which he belonged , was the gracious revival and series of revivals , with which it pleased God to honor the labor of his servants . It was not until the spring of 1846 , that any symptoms appeared of a general awakening among the Nestorians . There was , ' indeed , a crumbling down of old superstitions , and a growing recognition of the truths of the Gospel ; but after twelve years of missionary toil , the work began in the seminaries with great power and suddenness , and spread through the villages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so charming in its natural features . We shall hardly be justified in quoting from Mr. Stoddard 's numerous and jubilant letters , in regard to this glad outpouring of the Spirit , so widely have these recitals been published . Mr. Stod // dard comments in strong language upon the higher significance and blessedness of a revival on missionary ground , over revivals at home , and says the joy of one is not worthy to be compared with that of the other . The history of the book , as a personal narrative , culminates in the journey taken by Mr. Stoddard in failing health , with his wife and nurse and two children , in the summer of 1848 , to Trebizond , and thence with his motherless children , and a bleeding heart , to Constantinople , and so home . It is not often that God calls his servants anywhere to a greater trial of faith and patience , than befell Mr. Stoddard , with scarcely a note of warning upon arriving at Trebizond . Detained in that city by an event so wholly providential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarmed , he yet found that delay the most critical event in his history . Reaching the quarantine ground , he learnedthat the existence of cholera was suspected , not ascertained , and had he known this a few hours earlier he would have been able to seek a mountain village , and so escape exposure . But as it was , his wife arriving there in good health , with the exception of a little natural fatigue , was seized with the pestilence , and in a few hours fell a victim to its destructive power . At the dead of night he committed her remains to the dust , and " clasping his babes to his bosom , fled from the infected city . " The nurse speedily followed her mistress to the grave , and Mr. Stoddard , enfeebled by disease and spent with sorrow , embarked for his long sea voyage , in sole charge of his tender offspring . Mr. Stoddard was absent from his field of labor three years , and after his return , spent the six that followed , happily and usefully among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1857 ' , was laid to rest in the little burying ground of the mission premises at Mount Seir . But few events checkered the surface of his short , but serene and beautiful life ; he glided out of sight like a shining river , bearing on its bosom a precious and richly freighted burden . Dr. Thompson has executed his task with fidelity and taste it has been with him a labor of love ; he was evidently the man for the work ,  --  his own early life was interwoven with // that of his friend and classmate , their sentiments were alike , and their habits and pursuits congenial ; as biographer , he everywhere retires behind his subject , leaving him to tell his own story in his letters , by which , " though dead , he yet speaketh , " and in the end , leaving daguerreotyped upon the reader 's mind , a clear and radiant image of one of the most symmetrically perfect characters , ever ripened for heaven on the missionary field . There is a difficulty , almost if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thompson wisely has not attempted a formal portraiture ; it steals into the mind of the reader from his own artless words , and from his consistent and self-poising life , as much from what he did not do , as from what he did . We should hesitate to single out any virtue as especially characteristic of him , unless it was consecration to his Master in the missionary work . He was affectionate ; while we read his letters to his father and mother , we should say pre-eminently affectionate , but it never betrayed him into weakness , made his step less firm in turning his back upon home and country , or his spirit less cheerful in the mjdst of toil and trial . lie was a scholar , and with true ardor devoted to the honor and progress of science , but it was scholarship not so much tempered and balanced by missionary zeal , as informed and actuated by it . We should never think of entering into a defense of Stoddard 's devotion to astronomical investigation , any more than we should of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were equally implements of his Christian work . Never , indeed , was astronomy more truly in its place and function . In the person of Stoddard it returned to its birth-place , not as it went.forth in its youth , the companion of astrology , but in the stature of a glorious maturity , the handmaid and herald of religion . There is something beautiful in the fitness of God 's providence , that beneath those Persian skies , where shepherds first learned to call the stars by name , and where wise men were led by a star to the infant Redeemer , that now , in the nineteenth century , an American missionary should be searching those very skies , and not in vain , for some star to guide the benighted Mussulman to Christ . If we were to select one scene from Mr. Stoddard 's // life , most characteristic of him , and most worthy to be photographed to his memory for the friends of modern missions , it should be that first one described by his pen , when standing by the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shows him " the belts and moons of Jupiter , the rings of Satnrn , and his satellites , the gibbous appearance of Mars , and the wond ers of the milky way , "  --  the astrologer stroking his beard , and saying , " God is great , and truly you are one of the wise ones of the earth , " and the youthful missionary saying , " if Moolahs will permit us to take them by the hand , and lead them in the paths of science , the time is near when we can lead them to the Lamb of God . " The very climate of Persia , as it gave birth to astronomy , so it must make it a power for all time . We learn from Mr. Stoddard , that they had in Oroomiah no dew , and scarcely saw a cloud during June , July , August and September ; that stars do not twinkle when forty degrees above the horizon ; and Venus is so brilliant that he had distinguished by its light , when fourteen feet from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letters of a book . We can not deny ourselves the pleasure of again quoting from his pen , when writing to a brother-in-law , a missionary in India . p. 348 . " By the way , speaking of our climate , I am reminded to tell you of some discoveries I have lately made , which are very interesting , to myself at least . I noticed a few months ago , a statement that a scientific traveler had seen the satellites ( or some of them ) of Jupiter from the top of Mount Etna . The announcement was received with a good deal of interest , as most astronomers have denied the possibility of any such phenomenon being visible to the unassisted eye . On reading the account I thought I would test the power of the naked eye Acre , as it seemed to me we were under the most favorable circumstances possible for this purpose . We are elevated more than a mile above the ocean , and have for months a cloudless sky , and a very dry and transparent atmosphere , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know not how it is in India , but I think you would be astonished to see with what sharpness of outline mountains sixty , seventy , or even a hundred miles off , loom up on our view . In the night the heavens are magnificent , and it needs but a glance to assure a new comer that this is a very different place from America for the practical astronomer . I have often used my telescope here ( I have one which I made in college  --  a Newtonian of six feet focus , and five inches aperture ) and been delighted with the distinctness and beauty of the different telescopic objects ; but until last summer it never occurred to me to test my unassisted eye . I have now the satisfaction of assuring you that // I have thus seen several of Jupiter 's moons , the elongation of Saturn 's ring , ( the planet appearing plainly elliptical , ) and with a dark glass of just the right opacity , I have seen the phases of Venus . Last time I looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defined crescent . I have also found that stars which I know to be telescopic elsewhere , are here detected , under favorable circumstances , by the naked eye . I have made out a list of some of these , and sent them , with a full account of my observations , to Sir J. Herschel , and I have the vanity to think they will interest him deeply . Indeed , it will be an interesting fact to any one , if here , in a region where astronomy was studied thousands of years ago by Assyrian and Persian shepherds , the observer can be gratified by a view of wonders which , it has been supposed , only the telescope could reveal . As an illustration of the interest connected with these matters , let me say that it has long puzzled astronomers to account for the fact that in ancient books , written long before the discovery of the telescope , Saturn is represented as of an oblong shape . Was this a shrewd guess ? Was it prophecy ? had the ancients any knowledge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here on Mount Seir ? I should like , if I had time , and I was sure you would like to go into the subject , to detail to you the various ways in which I tried to train my eye for this purpose . Suffice it to say , that it was a month , from the time I began to examine Jupiter , before I felt sure I was successful in my object . I looked at it through the empty tube of a telescope , that my eye might not be distracted with the images of other stars . I looked at it near the corner of a building , which cut off its brightest rays , still leaving the view unobstructed to the right hand or the left ; and I looked at it when shining out in his full splendor . But all without success . At last , when watching it from its first appearenee in the evening , at a point just between daylight and dark , when there was darkness enough on the one hand for the satellites to appear , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , to obscure them , my highest hopes were gratified , and I jumped for joy . " We ought to niention that Mr. Stoddard devoted himself chiefly to the educational interests of the Kestorian mission , although he was systematically engaged in preaching the gospel , and had an assigned field among the villages , in which lie was a successful preacher . Still the school room was the chief theatre of his labors , and so rapidly did the institution grow of which he was the head , that it became not only a normal school for the supply of teachers , but a theological seminary for the training of preachers of the gospel . We are disposed , therefore , to attach considerable importance to Mr. Stoddard 's opinions upon the controverted question of the relative importance of teaching an d preaching ; and we think that the following remarks in a letter to Rev. Mr. Williams of Mosul , apart from the character and experience of the writer , will commend themselves to the approbation of our readers . // " My impression is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business of teaching has been overdone ; that a vast amount of strength has been expended in village schools , very imperfectly superintended , and in India , under heathen teachers , which might have been better expended in the direct preaching of the gospel . The business has been greatly overdone here , as we , nearly all of us , firmly believe . Many of our village schools have accomplished nothing ; and the reason is that they were not and could not be brought under a direct religious influence . Mr. Stocking visited them once a month and did the very best he could ; but his visit was a flying one , and the moment he passed by to look after the other seventy-nine schools , things reverted to their old course . That course in many cases was a sad one . Since some of the teachers and their older scholars have become pious , we have learned abominations which we never dreamed of at the time they were enacted . For example , one young man told me that , when at school in Ada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then go away to gamble ! Of course they learned nothing , but whenever the boy , placed on the roof to watch , cried out , Sabib is enterin* the village , ' then there was a whirl for a few moments and the school was all in grand order and the teacher at his post ! " While this has been true of many of our schools , and especially those in the remote villages and those taught ( ? ) by mercenaries , it has not ( bless God ) been true of all . On the contrary , o4r schools in Geog Tapa , for example , have done a noble work and a work which I believe could have been brought forward in no other way . They have stimulated the masses with a desire for improvement , and are , in my opinion , at the foundation of most that is really good in the village . " In a word , I am in favor of village schools only when they can be brought under teachers decidedly pious , who labor not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his own blood . We even now have few enough of such ' teachers , but , let them be few or many , I think we should adhere to this rule . " In regard to seminaries , in charge of missionaries , who give themselves to their work , I believe they are beyond all price in carrying forward the chariot of salvation , and especially where constant and jealous care is taken that they are not secularized . Our experience is very decided on this subject . So is that of the Ceylon mission . If we are ever to finish up our work-I mean we missionariesand go to new fields , it is of immense importance ( I know not how to use language strong enou , *h ) that we have natives in considerable numbers , of well disciplined minds , as well as fired with apostolic zeal . How we are to get them I do not see , unless we establish seminaries like ours at Seir , and then try by God 's blessing to pervade them with the influences of God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am , I do not preach to my scholars . It is one of the best of audiences too . What a privile*e to have such an audience to preach to from morning to night . It ought to tell on the welfare of these Nestorians greatly , and if it does not , I shall be free to say that we have wrestled too little on our knees for the blessing . " Another instance , no less creditable to Mr. Stoddard 's soundness of judgment and breadth of view , may be quoted from his writings on the very grave question , to what extent our // missionaries should prosecute their work of revival under and within the frame-work of the eastern churches , and in what circumstances they should lead out a distinct church organized on the simple principles of Protestantism . Hitherto , the missionaries of the Board have aimed at a reformatiou and revival of the Nestorian church rather than a separate ecclesiastical organization ; and with this policy Mr. Stoddard concurred . At the same time he was not unmindful of the dangers incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate of the advantages and disadvantages , that he was wedded to no a yriori theory , but prepared to judge of and decide the question in the light of those developing facts , which will , no doubt , in due time , make the path of duty plain . It is certainly highly creditable to our missionaries , to their freedom from sectarianism and their purely Christian and spiritual aims , that they have so long labored in harmony with the spiritual rulers of the Nestorians ; and we may challenge history to produce another example of equal magnanimity and Christian forbearance . The subject , however , is so important , and interlocks itself so naturally with the history and principles of the Protestant Reformation , and the following sentiments exhibit so clearly the wisdom and impartiality of Mr. Stoddard , that we give them room . " I will now take up the question , what do you conceive to be the actual working of the church relation among the Nestorians , and especially the converted Nestorians ? ' " To this I reply , that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , and inseparable from it . Those to the converts themselves may be briefly stated . 1st . They are more or less tempted to violate their consciences by conforming to the foolish and sometimes the sinful practices of their church . The temptation is of course , however , far less than in the Armenian church , because there are not nearly so many corrupt usages , such as image worship , confession to the priest , etc. , and because conformity to these corrupt usages can not be enforced , at least on the plain , by excommniiication , fine , or imprisonment . If any individual , therefore , yields compliance , it is because he chooses to do so ; and by yielding he detracts from the evidence we otherwise have of his piety . If we are correctly informed as to what has taken place in Erzeroom , not even a Protestant church organization can prevent such weaknesses and sins among oriental Christians . 2d . Some persons are thus deterred from becomin , , ecclesiastics , and their influence is , consequently , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extent we desire them to have , the ordinances of baptism and // 889 the Lord 's supper . 4th . They do not enjoy the privileges of Christian fellowship , as they would if separated from the corrupt mass around them , and gathered into a Protestant church . 5th . They probably have not so strong a sympathy with us , nor with each other , nor so much unity of action in their plans for doing good . " These are certainly grave objections to our present mode of operation ; and , if things were permanently to continue as they are now , I think our duty would be plain to follow the example of our brethren in Turkey . But neither we nor the converts shall remain long in this position . A few years must entirely change the aspect of things . If this temporary union of new and old , purity and partial corruption , is strange , it is perhaps no more so than what existed in the days of the apostles , the New Testament being witness . " Meanwhile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converts . There are very few communities where I believe the hopefully pious are so faithfully watched over as those in our seminaries . We could not do more for them , in this respect , if they were gathered into a church . " But , you will ask , do the converts manifest no tendency to go back to the darkness from which they have partially emerged ? So far from this being the case , it seems to me clear that , as a body , and , I may almost say , in every individual case , they are all making progress in the right direction ; and , although there is now a lamentable deficiency of the Holy Spirit 's influence , I have never seen a more decided and healthy onward progress than at the present time . This opinion I express after ten years of careful observation . " Now allow me to state some of the advantages of the present system . It is my impression , from what I have seen in Turkey , that the tendency of things there is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Being severed from the old church , they are of course in great danger of attacking the superstitious practices to which they were formerly themselves wedded , with more earnestness than they show in telling those around them the simple story of the cross . This is an evil from which we are happily exempt here . I have no doubt our good brethren in Turkey would oppose this tendency with all their hearts , but it is of course difficult for them in the circumstances to control it . On the other hand the converts here are in danger of being too liberal in their feelings , and embracing , in the arms of a large charity , those whom we and the Bible would exclude from fellowship . However this may be , it is certainly a fact of great importance that these pious natives , instead of being distracted with endless and unhappy discussions , are so free to preach the cardinal doctrines of the Gospel , which , I hope , will sooner or later , though perhaps not nearly so fast as those who travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whatever is corrupt in opinion or in practice among their people . " Moreover , the sympathies of the converts are now better drawn out for their people than they could be if placed in an antagonistic relation to them . Said one of them to me , lately , when I suggested the possibility of a new organization : What ! would you separate us from our people ? Are we no more to feel that we are one with them , and they one with us ? Shall we not sympathize with our brethren , our kinsmen according to the flesh in all their joys and sorrows ? Shall we be the first to raise a separating wall ? Shall we thus cast them out , as evil , and knowingly make them our enemies ? Is it proved that we can not follow Chiist // Dr. fIi'komp8om ' 8 Memoir of Stoddard . Nov. , and yet be Nestorians ? Will you begin among us a civil war ? ' I give you the above remarks as indicative of the feelings of most , indeed I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any who would be glad to break up their present connection with the people , I am not aware of the fact . " You will also remember that , should a Protestant church be established here , the wide door which is now thrown open for the preaching of the Gospel must at once be closed . It is vain to hope that we can freely enter Kestorian churches , or gather congregations in many different villages , or exert any perceptible influence on the mass of the people , after such a blow has been struck at the present organization . Our native helpers , instead of going out , as now , to scatter broadcast the seed of the kingdom , would be hemmed in on every side . Our numerous village schools would , most of them , be put down , and the circulation of the Holy Scriptures be very much diminished . If we can anticipate with confidence any thing in the future , I think we may anticipate such a result as this ; and the experience of our brethren in Turkey is far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although a fear of any such calamity should not tempt us for a moment to pursue a course which is wrong , it ought to make us very careful how , without due reflection , we launch on an untried sea . " I am also persuaded that we are taking the best way to put an end to the abuses which prevail here . It seems to me that combating fasts and feasts and the prevailing system , will never effect much , until the people truly feel their need of something better . While we have not attacked their errors directly , at least not so as to make them more prominent than the cross of Christ , we have not failed , in senson and out of season , year after year , and in multitudes of places , to declare the whole counsel of God . I do not believe the Gospel is preached anywhere with more earnestness and fidelity than it is in Oroomiah . And it is precisely on this account that a basis is now laid , as I believe , for a much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Light and love are stripping off the robe of self-righteousness , which the boisterous wind would only have wrapped more tightly around them . The opening of the window-shutters is removing the darkness and letting in the light , whereas the use of the broom would only have created a suffocating dust , while all remained still darker than before . " While I am evidently leaning , as you see , to our present mode of operation as the best one , I am free to admit that it would be more grateful to my feelings , if the above considerations were left out of the account , to labor even in a small , but doctrinally pure church , than to carry out the imperfect , half-way system which we now , for a season , tolerate . I believe we all sincerely desire to know what time will of the Lord is , and are willing to follow at once , wherever the path shall be plainly pointed out . And I ask your prayers that , free from pride and prejudice , and any blinding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed to us by the Board , the churches , and above all , by our blessed Lord and Master himself . " In the following year , Mr. Stoddard added , upon the same subject , what pi-obably represented his state of mind at the period of his death , the following remarks : // " December 15th , 1854 . I have read with delight and gratitude the account of the meeting of the Board at Hartford , and I have rio doubt it is read with delight and gratitude throughout the world . It is cause of special thanksgiving that you were so harmonious on a subject which produces everywhere so much excitement . I hope this new year will be one of rich blessings to all our missions . As for ourselves , I think I see some signs of a retrograde movement for a year or two , and I confess I look forward to the future with some anxiety . As soon as it shall be definitely settled that we can not vigorously prosecute the reformation in. the church , I shall be in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so precious a harvest lost . Hitherto I believe our course has been a wise one , but not unattended with peril . The pious Nestorians have so much lumber to carry round on their backs that it is more difficult than you may imagine for them to stand up , freemen in Christ Jesus . You will be glad to know that we have held a communion season , at which a number of them were invited , and we expect to have another the first of next month . Our plan is , as soon as we can bring it about , to have all the pious Nestorians commune with us three times in a year or once in four months . They need sadly the benefit of this ordinance , administered in a solemn arid scriptural manner . " We had marked other topics to which we had hoped to have time to allude , but we must omit them . The thought has grown upon us , as we have been following the narrative of this holy and beautiful life , how the Great head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian civilization in this western world , to ingraft it upon the decaying stock and among the lifeless branches of the Christianity of the East . The word of God can not make progress in our world except by the consecration to God of the costliest , the dearest , and the best . The law that brought the Son of God from the Father 's bosom still hold* and as in apostolic days , so now , Christians must " 1111 up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ , in their flesh for His body 's sake , which is the church . " The life that is to revive the dead churches of the East , must come from the best life of the West . The light that shall re-illume the seven candlesticks of Asia , now dark , must be carried to them from the blazing altars of Christian England and America . What is it but the life of Christ prolonged , and his death lived over again , when from the best Christian culture of New England , the blossom of families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's service , from the parish of Jonathan Edwards , and from the grave of David Brainerd , the youthful Stoddard goes forth to insert his life // into the Nestorian , and to hallow with his dust the soil of Persia , as before him Martyn had , whose feet had never strayed around Brainerd 's grave , but whose spirit had caught inspiration from his life ? As it is the law of love for the highest to seek the lowest , and " the chiefest to be servant of all , " so it is the condition of redemption , for the pure to mingle with the impure , the enlightened with the degraded , and mingling with them to suffer with and for them . It is the lesson of the incarnation , abiding in the church as a type and a spirit ; " the disciple is not above his Master , " and they who with apostolic zeal succeed to the Redeemer 's work , do " always bear about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus . " And this work is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are but drops that precede the shower . The lonely grave of M*rtyn at Tocat , and that of Stodaard looking out solitarily from Mount Seir , will ere long be surrounded with kindred in Christ , and saintly dnst shall hallow not only the old historic countries from whence the human race began their pilgrimages , and over which walked the Son of God , but it shall yet be thickly strown over the islands of the ocean , and through those central regions of Africa which God still curtains closely from the gaze and research of His church . Instead of thinking that our refinement is too great , and our culture too perfect for the work of missions , we are rather bound to believe that the piety has not yet been nurtured , nor the resources gathered of learning and Christian magnanimity , which are . adequate to the work , and fitted to the sacrifice of laying foundations amid the central darkness of heathenism . Forth from happier and holier homes , from higher ranks of scholarship in universities and seminaries of sacred learning , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favored with the presence of their Lord , and communions nearer that above , must missionaries go , before " the heathen shall be given to Christ for his inheritance , and the uttermost parts of the earth for his possession. **
